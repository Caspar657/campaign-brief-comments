Yep,"Saw this a couple of days ago and ended up googling the background of the story, just chilling.
Pretty powerful piece of communication."
"I support the issue, but...","Just actors.
Cringeworthy.
Not convincing."
punch in the guts,"Wow. That’s one of the most challenging and traumatic pieces of film I’ve ever seen.
Also one of the best this year."
Grim Reaper,"Why watch the film…when you gave the ending in the title.
Also…it runs about 2 minutes too long."
Wow,"Wow @I support the issue, but…
You are such a badass. You should feel proud of your steeliness. Maybe more of us should learn from such a hard man as you and not let ourselves be swayed by just a bunch of pithy actors. Pfft, I bet we haven’t experienced real, real life like you have."
really?,"Trouble with ‘powerful/emotionally charged’ spots like this is that after a hard days work they’re the last thing you want to watch, so you just reach for the remote and get yourself a little mind numbing Family Feud."
I think,"This is stunning and important work.  Well done all involved.  I had to press the STOP button and didn’t watch it through.  Too close to the bone for me from recent experience.  But pressing STOP is the point.  We shouldn’t have to experience this, there should be a STOP button, we shouldn’t be controlled by the churches."
Denzil,"Brilliantly made, brutally simple, highly effective.
Nice one!"
The Horror is Here,"‘Stop The Horror’ – see how long you can scroll down, reading all these stupid, negative comments… PS: Great work guys."
Not So New AD Guy,"That was really hard to watch. A not so nice idea for a not so nice problem.
Nice work Cummins."
be real,"@Grim Reaper
It runs 2 mins too long? Do you get the idea? Perhaps it went over your noggin. Shame.
This is a confronting, shocking & very well made piece of film, congratulations to the collaborators who were brave enough to take it on."
Typical jerk,"I’m one of those jerks that never leaves a comment unless it’s negative. But not this time! Really like it, good, simple, powerful and gets better the more I think about it. Nice job!"
Really old guy,Brilliantly written and filmed.
Great,"Really hope the motivation for this piece of pro bono was to actually stop this horror rather than win awards.
Very powerful film, I couldn’t watch it all and clicked through to sign the petition."
Mark Left Feld ( Field),"YEAH I GUES.
BUT ITS A BIT HARD TO GET STUFF. SAD SOB STORY. HARD TO KNOW."
Jen.,It’s good. Good but easy brief. Shock people into helping. Good to see c&p doing pro bono. Doesn’t come naturally to the money men of advertising.
J,Concerned that the focus is more on the family and not on the actual patient that is suffering…
Kelly,Cripes @I support the issue! – would you prefer we invaded the lives of a real family going through the pain of it all? You have no idea. Seriously…
