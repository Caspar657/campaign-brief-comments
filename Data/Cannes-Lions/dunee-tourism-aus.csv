Stitch up,The loop hole that it ran in the Australian streamed telecast of the Super Bowl is about as legitimate as running a print ad on the back page of the Manly Daily.
Stitch up your wounds,"^you can’t argue that it’s the best commercial from an Australian advertiser – regardless of where it ran, it’s a deserved winner."
me,Hi fuck wit creatives (ie old school copywriters and art directors in ad agencies) – this is a wonderful piece of work. It’s one of the few reasons you still remain relevant.  It’s bloody brilliant.  Please celebrate it.  This piece of work is one of the few reasons you still have a job  – the promise of this kind of thinking is why people come to you.  COngratulations Tourism Australia and D5 – outstanding.
Rightio,"An American agency, does an ad for an American audience, that runs on American TV . . . and wins an award for best ad on Australian TV."
^,Great stuff.
R.I.P Steve Irwin,"Throw another shrimp on the barbie. Droga’s an Aussie, even if the company failed in Australia."
Ben,"To be fair, it’s not like the rest of the Logies aren’t rigged."
great ad,"No doubt, it’s a cracker of an ad and a concept."
In reality,It was the old ‘movie poster/movie tralier’ for ad cliché done yet again…
