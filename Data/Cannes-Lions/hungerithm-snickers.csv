Mr. Original,"Reminds me of a Jetstar idea, I’ve seen recently…I think."
Monkey,Love it! Well done.
Joe Sibley,"Ridiculously amazing. Hi Shannon, Jackson and Jim."
ASOS BOY REPRESENT,So fucking good Jackson! Dynamite as hell.
Haters?,"C’mon, where’s all the haters and their diatribe?
Don’t you know the angrier you get the cheaper Snickers will be?! Love it."
JB,Fark. The comments on this blog alone could put them out of business. Nice work!
Alfie Crowe,Go Mum!
Zac,"If it monitors the comments here prices should be dirt cheap.
Nice idea though."
JB,Fuck off Sibley.
Robbie B,Awesome. Clever and fun. Who’d have thought.
Making hungry complicated,"Just let people eat when they want without having to worry about a user experience.
Snickers are awesome, cheap and sell like mad. So the problem was? Sorry, it just seems unnecessary."
Great,"More ideas like this please. Not just a clever use of tech bht an interesting way to bring the brand’s proposition to life.
Well done."
Jen,Lovely idea. Well done.
Jon,"Pretty damn similar to my student work 2 years ago…

Grrrrr,"I fucking hate this, grrrrr, I’m so mad and angry. Argh! Now give me a snickers."
Zac,"@Jon – Yup, you’re right, it was stolen from your student video that has 71 views…"
Jon,"@Zac – It was an unlisted video. So those 71 videos were all from agency creatives who had the direct link. I’ll never know, but the resemblance is striking."
@Jon,"Oh poor baby,
Grow up, idiot. Come up with a new idea. It should be easy. And always remember, no one likes a sook. If you’re such a hot shot that creatives at Clems Melb need to steal your work then finding your own great job and selling your work to a real client should be a breeze."
Meatwave anyone?,"Pretty damn similar to Grill’d Meatwave – The hotter it gets, the cheaper the burgers.

In fact I feel like I’ve seen a heap of the  ________ier _________ gets the cheaper the _________ the last few years."

Pizzas get cheaper when you tweet,https://www.simplyzesty.com/blog/article/march-2012/domino-s-uk-use-tweets-to-knock-down-the-price-of-pizza
@ @jonsaid,"Acting like a spoilt little cry baby brat (who obviously works at Clems) makes you look like a complete muppet.
You may not have copied this kid’s work but there’s no need to act like an asshole in order to defend your work."
