Props,for actually pulling this off. Like it a lot.
Wow,This has a Palau Pledge / Meet Graham level of grandness to it
Nice,"…Idea.
Timely.
Positive.
Respect."
Congrats,Imagine it took a mountain of work to get this over the line – great ideas always do. Good for the world and good news in these dark times. Love the idea guys.
Huge,"Nothing but congrats on this one. Fantastic idea, executed at meaningful scale. Jealous."
Sgt. Sard,Very nice.
Homesick,"Brilliant work, and the type of stuff that makes me (and I’m sure others who’ve left over the years) fall back in love with the industry.
Maybe even dip the toe back in? Genuine, effective work, with soul and sophistication. Well done to all involved, you should all be proud of yourselves for getting this idea made."
JaseR,Great idea. Well done.
brilliant,I’m standing and clapping
Once in a lifetime idea,"Bravo Adam and Pete, bravo."
@Once in a lifetime idea,"Oh come on, let’s not ruin the vibes with the obvious and insecure self-congratulatory call out. There’s 100 people on the list of credits.
They wouldn’t be there if it was a two man party."
pearcey,"this is really, really great. well done to all."
Production,Incredible film craft there. Shows what we can make here in Oz when we’re given the scripts.
Mac Wright,I love you Adam & Pete.
Craig,Amazing idea.
just sayin,Thats how you do it.
Stu T,Incredible idea. Well done to all involved.
Book your tickets....,You’re headed to the sunny beaches of the south of France!
Hello,Well done Adam and Pete. A genuine and brilliant idea fellas and a long time in the making!
Jealousy,"This is the first thing I’ve been proper jealous of in a while. Congratulations to all involved.
At least this thread will be more wholesome than the Cadbury Gorilla debacle"
Clinton,Genuinely excellent
JB,Spirko and team – this is an absolute banger! Nicely done.
Az,Love it.
The reward is the awards,Kudos for getting it through and no doubt you’ll pick up awards from it. But let’s not kid ourselves here… that was the main aim. In no way will this actually make a difference. Who uses cash anymore anyway? 99% of places are actively discouraging cash payment now thanks to COVID.
Huge Journey,LOVE this idea. Well done everyone.
Will do what it was created to do,And that is….. drumroll please….. win awards. 
Brilliant but too late,"Newsflash, nobody uses coins any more.
Two years ago, this idea would have been awesome. Today it’s useless."
Brilliant,"It’s such a neat idea and it’s real. To anyone saying don’t just congratulate Adam and Pete you need to know the history of this idea. This idea has been in the making for years now and I’m sure the team at Saatchi and Saatchi helped make it better, but it was Adam and Pete and some others at Publicis that should be given the majority of the credit. Well done all. It’s amazing."
PD,You don’t see ideas like this every day. Especially not in Aus. Kudos
@Will do what it was created to do,"If it’s easier for you, you can just tap homeless people and seeing eye dogs on the head with your credit card until they beep."
Ben,"Given this was clearly in the works well before COVID, and the fact that plenty of people actually do use coins…and the idea isn’t to actually get these coins donated, it should be celebrated as a cracker of an idea, for a brilliant cause."
Allie,I genuinely love this. 
Really nice,Great work from the guys who actually came up with SCUBER.
Rivet,"This is bloody good work, first saw it as a news article – didn’t know it was from agency. Feels huge, very jealous –  Congrats on getting it up"
Sadly Infantile,"This is a wonderful idea that shows persistence to get it over the line.
It is a sad commentary that it is already trivialised with references to awards and Cannes.
Surely it would be so much better to just enjoy the reward of a great idea doing its job."
TK,Absolute respect. Can’t even imagine the journey from inception to sharing it today. Hats off to everyone involved.
@BigMac,"It’s one thing to conceive, quite another to make. As it takes a village to raise a child, so to it takes many people to bring an idea like this to life. Show some grace, dignity and thank them, instead of reducing this to a self promotion exercise. Trust me."
qt3.14,Yuge idea. Biggest I’ve seen in a long time. Brilliant.
Pay attention,Adam and Pete are genuinely emerging as the creative names to watch in Australia.
Very cool,Not often you come up with an OOH ad that lasts for 40 years. 
ClientKudos,"Well done to the team at The Royal Australian Mint, Mark Cartwright, Frederica Heacock and Nicolle Keye.
The tactics don’t get executed so brilliantly, nor made without brave, strategic and purpose driven marketers like you."
I like,Very nice. Congrats.
bobthebuilder,Huge. Well done. And a great cause. Couldn’t ask for a better campaign to be part of.
I'm a fan,"Not that i use money anymore, this is a really nice idea, well done Saatchi + Saatchi"
Old CD Guy,What an excellent initiative and film.
I love everything about it,"Except the design of the coin. Sorry, i’m afraid of spiders so all i see is a web. Great idea though and the design is lovely on everything else."
Georgie P,Well done Adam and Pete and Jack!   Years and years of persisting with a brilliant idea has been rewarded.  Awesome.
Dan O,Got real currency minted.  Amazing.
Qanonymous,THIS IS SHIT
BH,Absolutely brilliant. Congrats to all involved.
Well done Adam and Pete,Wasn’t this a Publicis idea? Or is Publicis now Saatchi? I do wonder how much some of those credited did but I won’t doubt Adam and Pete. Best up and coming creatives in Australia.
Small coin,Big impact. This one will live for as long as we’re using physical currency.
Cool Nana (NZ),"Yes, well done Saatchi & Saatchi & everyone involved especially my granddaughter"
Slurps,Such a good idea. Well done to everyone involved.
Beautiful,…   it’s seamless and belongs in the real world.  I’m on the board of a charity and I’ve already asked them how we are leveraging this. It’s not about the literal coin (although it could be) it’s a reminder to donate to that charity you always mean to. I think charities will be competing for the donation dollar and coming across them in rotation will act as a nudge to donate again. Well done!
Wow,Doesn’t get much better than this
Is it original though?,The royal mint have been making money to give to the homeless for years.
Rich,"Well done to everyone involved in this.
It would have been so easy to give up along the way and you did not.
You have made me feel very happy about what we do."
Sean Cummins,Blown away by this. A beautiful idea hiding in plain sight.
Tommy D,This is going to get more Lions than a guy with a limp in the Serengeti.
RC,So simple. So brilliant. Bravo.
Lasting,Not only a great idea but one that will last and make a difference for years. Well done to all involved. Love it.
Henry,"This is brilliant, one of the best pieces of work this year. Hope to find one of these coins in the near future."
the little boy who could,You worked so hard on this Jack – well done
Congrats,So jealous. Wish I did it.
RP,"Brilliant idea from two brilliant creatives. Well done, Big A and Big P."
Come on,"Takes a team to get an idea up, take two brilliant creative minds to have it. Well done to you, Adam and Pete."
Beyond the idea,"This gives me some hope in our industry. It’s huge without being a scam.
And hope in this hate filled blog. Positivity, finally."
Degree of difficulty,Deceptively simple. So jealous. Good on ya Baggers and co
Steve Callen,This is a great idea.
great,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-3dXBk0o9A
MB,Alpass is a great man and an even greater designer. Looks super slick mate.
Don’t kid yourself,"The press release states the problem;
“Sadly, a shift away from notes and coins has had unforeseen and significant consequences on Australian charities.”"
@Don't kid yourself,Think you’ve missed the point. The problem is donations are way down. Think this idea will help fix that problem in some way… hopefully lots of ways once 25M coins get out there. Try and look on the bright side of life champion…
@Don't kid yourself,Why are you sad?
Mike,Excellent.
Can someone tell me,Why the Royal Australian Mint need to advertise?
Former Colenso creative,"Man, I remember when Nick Worthington had this exact idea and tried to get BNZ and NZ mint to back it but despite several efforts over the years, it never got up. "
Jay,"Awesome idea, Adam and Pete. Top stuff."
Nah,Just googled coins of hope. 
Bezier,It’s the best thing any of the Saatchi’s have done in years. Massive props. Will be keeping an eye on these two creatives.
And many more,"This is a great. Simple. Big.
Would have taken a lot of dedication to get this over the line. You need a culture that believes in the power of ideas to make this kind of work.
It wins everything."
3 things about this that make me despair for our industry,"1 – the hate. Seriously, all you sad people with nothing to do but anonymously yell at people on blogs. It’s pathetic. "
Still,Wondering what or whom this is advertising?
@Still,"I would suspect this does a pretty amazing job for the Mint to prove that even in the digital age, coins can play a relevant and important role in society."
Thank you,"This is an initiative that makes the world a better place. There is only good that can come from it.
A big Well Done.
And as an Australian, THANK YOU."
Great idea,"Course, it was a great idea when I presented it to you for the Salvos at BWM, except the coin was red instead of green. Lucy Trengrove even started speaking to the mint about making it happen. Anyway, good on you both for actually making it happen now. Had you not, it would forever be in my bottom drawer. It’s way better out in the world."
@Great idea,Presented it to who exactly?
@Great Idea,I remember this idea being presented at BWM and Lucy contacting the mint about it making it happen.
Outstanding,"This is bigger than the advertising industry. Top idea. This is people coming together to elevate our humanity. Outstanding. Best I have seen in a long time. And it will keep helping people for decades, long after all the current tv commercials and billboards have disappeared. All of us in the NFP space (not just the Salvos) are delighted."
@Great idea,Yes this was orginally for the Salvo’s but it never got made. Bangers took the idea from all the roadblocks at BWM and actually did it. So would you rather have an idea never happen or be out there helping people?
Always amazes me,"If you steal an idea wholesale in any other industry, you get sued. When you do it in advertising, you get awarded."
