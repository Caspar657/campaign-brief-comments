concrete foundations,"pretty impressive, but a lot of effort to go through when you could just not live in queensland"
Standing up,Clapping
Fresh Thinking,Feels original in a well trodden category and congrats on getting a doco made.
It's Meet Graham,Nicely shot though.
Seb V,"I maybe a little biased, but this is a lovely big idea. It’s a shame that it wasn’t pushed to actually get government standards changed (which i know Leo’s originally set out to do), but really nicely executed and a great link back to Suncorp. Well done Leo’s"
Meet Househam,Damn. Someone beat me to it.
Franc,This is brilliant.
pugwash,"yoiks, boring as batshit"
Em,This is great!
Doll's House,So it’s basically a model? Not quite that big.
Scratch beneath the surface,"OK, so while it’s commendable for a brand to want to solve a serious problem, they didn’t actually solve it. They’re not building these houses. They didn’t get the building codes changed. They’re not even changing their insurance policies to allow for damaged homes to be replaced/rebuilt with these technologies if the homeowner wants. In fact, they probably still don’t insure homes for flood if they’re in a floodzone. "
Derek,It has to be at least three times bigger
Great work,"This is epic, well done to all involved. And well done to all the negative commenters above. You deserve a pat on the back for contributing absolutely nothing to society."
Big idea,Now that’s a big idea. Congrats to all involved.
Ex Leo's,Congrats to the team who persevered to make this happen. It’s awesome!
Scratching my head,"That’s exactly what they’re trying to do @Scratch beneath the surface. Working with the CSIRO and James Cook is far from fluff, it’s tangible research that will affect building codes in the future. You’re an amateur."
House Fan,Well done Leo’s and we’ll done Eric and Marijke. Exceptional idea.
Darryl Kerrigan,"She’s no 3 Highview Crescent, but throw in a bit lattice for that Victorians charm and I reckon we’re onto a winner."
I like this,but has the physical home been built or is it just the plans?

JK,Outstanding – Recognise it when you see it.  Tip your hat and then try and beat it.  Bravo Mim and team.
This is great,Well done to Leo’s. Something very fresh
Love this,Very fresh. Well done Leo’s
Suckers,It’s a less creative Meet Graham.
Seriously,"Experts- check. Collaborators-check. Science- check. Data- check. Glue society- check. Social good- check. Documentary- check. Ok we are all set for some trophies. Don’t we need a better idea? Nah, they’ll never notice."
Graham,Lovely craft. But it is meet me tho.
I agree with Graham,Very similar construct
Graham,"To be fair, Meet Graham was a total ripoff of this 80s smoking campaign"
Yasmin Brooks,Amazing to see work that aims to change the world for good. Also huge yeah BOI for getting a big idea up. 
Matt Moran,I’d live here. Great to see something that pushes the category forward. I imagine this would have been a very hard sell internally.
...,Graham’s in da house.
Yep,This will win awards ppl. You watch.
Wat,“A modern take on the much-loved Queenslander”
Apple bowl,Great to see after 3 years this idea finally getting made.
Credit where credit’s due,Nice work. Better if all involved recognised.
shill boy,nice job frankenator
Shasha,Congratulations love these designs. Ready to build on my block of land. So then my insurance fee is zero?
Phillip Peters,"A range of existing building materials used in a specific and focused manner what an opportunity to actually get some changes in the various areas where where these concepts would save significant costs and anxiety amongst communities .
Not sure if this is the place to ask a question , but can someone advise what the tanks are manufactured from and how they actually survived the fire onslaught .
Thank you"
Ralph,"I think the concept, project and execution is excellent. Our RTO would love to use it as a case study in a Building & Construction qualification under development
Is it possible to access plans and materials take-off lists to be used solely for educational purposes?"
