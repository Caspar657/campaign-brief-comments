Astroturf,Stop smoking my shit…
Good one.,To all the foreign ECDs that say Aussie work is cheesy and shit. This should shut you up.
Gary Green,"To all the creatives that think this works, keep that in mind next time you are doing a spot and end up getting some businessman to send you 20 tracks of unsigned bands he is pushing around town, because it is ‘easier’ than doing something original. Music in advertising has been relegated to merely wallpaper in most campaigns. It can and should be a large part of ads, but the recent trends of leaving it all to the ‘bandpushers’ has had the opposite effect.
Nice to see somebody actually thinking about te effectiveness of original music."
The Ranger,That’s Gold! Metal Metal Metal.
