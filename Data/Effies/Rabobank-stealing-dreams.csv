Anonymous,"Shouldn’t the credits read
Whybin\TBWA\Tequila\Southpaw Sydney?
They’re an agency within an agency aren’t they?"
Anonymous,Awesome guys – lets hope it sparks the whole finance category to do great work…..
TH,This is funny. I like the pushed scenarios. Esp the hiding in the grass waiting for the hyenas… Bit like posting something on this blog really.
Anonymous,"Really solid work. Refreshing to see something like this for the financial sector. Well done for all involved for pushing the banking boundaries, and no doubt, you will be respected for this by juries here and beyond."
Anonymous,I’m on a horse.
Anonymous,not great
Anonymous,FUUUUNNNNNNNNNY.
Anonymous,You guys sure comment on your own work a lot.
Anonymous,"Like most people I was intrigued by what Matty and Dave would do at Whybins. You can’t argue with the reputations or the previous work but this leaves me a little cold. And as for ‘pushing the banking boundaries’ well I’m not sure. If this is the pinnacle of financial advertising in this country this year, then the pinnacle is low. I expected more from them and in the cold light of day I’m sure they will too."

-K,"Funny.
Well executed.
Cap tipped."
happily anonymous,"please….this is a crock of shit.
And the weird ass guy as presenter doesn’t help.
If you want TRAKTOR, ring them….otherwise do something else.
trying hard…but falling over…"
An inconvenient truth,"Nice, but isn’t it a bit politically awkward for Whybins to knock the major banks on the one hand and handle one of the biggies on the other?"
Extremely casual friday comment...,Lovely stuff. Funny and fresh. And strangely enough thought-provoking. I like the jacket… should have enough $ to buy one. God i hate my bank.

I would have thought it is a pretty good demonstration of separation between the Whybin offices.
As far as Rabo goes, ANZ is evil and to be challenged.
As far as ANZ goes, I doubt they know of or care about Rabo.
Different offices. Different markets."
Anonymous,"i was really quite impressed the first time i saw it yesterday
but i just watched it again and wow, it doesn’t hold up at all. the shock value is gone and there’s nothing to enjoy. i just hate the guy now."
Anonymous,"Good idea, crappy production values.
Brilliant performance from Simon Westaway!"
Chris,"I don’t work at whybins but as anyone who works in Adland would know we spend alot of time swearing at shit ads in ad breaks on tele. This came as a refreshing change when I saw it for the first time on tele last night. Nice one guys.
And for a bank too… Put that in your pipe and smoke it Mr Anonymous."
anonymous,Good!
Belinda of Sydney,"Haha this ad is so funny & rather creepy, I think I may have nightmares! Good to see a bank bringing in some humour. I don’t know who this bank is but now I remember the name so it does it’s job by thought provoking!"
Delia,Good work Jules!
Creepy OldAdman,"I love this ad!
This is the sort of work i show my friends around the office and laugh.
It’s brilliant, it’s funny and it comes from a truth. Everyone hates their bank, and if you don’t then you’re a moron.
This is awesome. I love the casting and the creepy face in the end.
shiiieet if i see another “happy banking” ad or the same rehash idea of that “surprise!”  from ANZ.  or NAB “breaking up”  or some monkey doing yoga.
It wont make me go to Rabobank. Probably because im too lazy to change banks,  but now they’re on my radar and before they weren’t."
