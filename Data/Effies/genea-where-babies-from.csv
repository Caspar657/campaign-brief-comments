It’s really fun and highly distinctive."
C-Diddy,Genuinely excellent.
Unreal,Incredible work. What a refreshing change for the category. Every hat I own is off to the team behind this.
Melbourne Joe,Excellent funny animation. I love the sperm and egg having a time.
Marrianne,This is going straight to the pool room.
Jen,@Lov it – have seen far more sanitised versions on YouTube pre-rolls – zero sex and zero genitals as far as I remember
Annalise,"This is fantastic – well done to the creative, production and especially the client team for being brave and making this work and being inclusive!"

Tuff Muff,The 70s alive and well with this level of pubic hair. LOL
Nice. But to pardon a pun,a little bit laboured.
@Nice,"I think it’s laboured, but that’s the point. The execution is outstanding, the message is so now, it is irreverent and super cool. It won’t win an effectiveness award though. The branding or call to action is non existent. If I want to talk about this I’m now doing a category job, for IVF broadly. Did you see that awesome IVF ad with the bonking cartoons?Kind of like dumb ways to die but for IVF."
The cherubs,Love it. Nice one Rich and Jeremy.
