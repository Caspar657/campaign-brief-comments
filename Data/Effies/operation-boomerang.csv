Field1,Field2
I'll be back,"Classic lines: “Mitch, no-one retires from backyard cricket.
Gary, get out of the pool.”
Well done Monkeys, this equal to Richie from last year."
Boom Boomerang,"A few gongs should come back from this effort.
Well done Monkeys."
How doggie dog,Well don son
Homesick,"This ad makes me wish I was home for Australia Day, but, never fear, the Aussie expats will have a few chops on the barbie in New York!"
Lee Lin Chin is Blofeld?,Love it overall but it took me a second viewing to realise Lee Lin Chin was playing the evil Blofeld character (with the white cat) from the early Bond movies. I’m sure it doesn’t matter but I wonder how many viewers under 50 would get that?
Bechdel test,"What’s with all the bros? I thought the idea was to make Australia a lamb nation, not a sausage fest."
Bearr,"Vegan !!! Abort mission!!! HA Ha Ha!!!
Love it haven’t laughed so out loud at an ad for ages!1 Well Done Monkeys not the lamb!! HA Ha Ha"
Joe,"Very nice.
Sharposs you legend! Bloody nice VFX from White Chocolate and great edit too Dan!
“Get out of the pool Gary”, classic line."
Gawen,Genius
TOIA,Fun to watch    nice job.
Don't get Carriered away,"Interestingly, while the US has 10, India has 2 and even Thailand has 1, Australia hasn’t had an aircraft carrier in its fleet since HMS Melbourne was decommissioned in 1982."
@Don't get Carriered away,HMAS Canberra
Don't get Carriered away,"Sorry, Canberra is a helicopter landing craft, not a fully fledged aircraft carrier, the type shown in this Lamb spot."
@dontgetcarrieredaway,Excuse me while I file this under non-fiction for you
Lamb chop,"The monkeys are hotter than droga 5 ever hoped to be.
Well done!"
@carriered,Are you one of those grown men that makes tiny model aeroplanes?
-GK,"@Don’t get Carriered away
It’s an ad, not a Wikipedia article."
7/10,"Average idea. Execution saves it a little. Agency clearly thinks this is funnier than it is.
Still nice."
Seems familiar,"Definitely seen the idea before but the craft elevates it to another level.
Hopefully it does the job and gets Davo and Trev buying lamb chops for the barbie. Not 100% on that, time will tell I guess."
Boomerang,Nice idea. Does it do more than be an ad? Are they brining people home? Also why is it only dudes they’re rescuing? White ones at that. I didn’t realise boomerangs worked that way.
"Can you come and ""extract"" me for Australia Day?",Please! It’s fucking freezing here.
Reality,"A little bit overhyped. Nothing special here, hopefully more to come."
Mike,Well done fellas. Massive props to move it on in such an interesting way.
Ned K,"Last years effort set a high bar. This year’s puts it in a different place altogether! Well done all involved, ya feckers!"
Well done,Princess Mary 
wonderful,"A marvellous celebration of that most traditional of Aussie values, intolerance of anything that’s different to the norm, vegans/ other peoples customs etc. Old jokes like warm beer etc, also it’s two minutes long  and we’ve got the joke after the first 5 seconds, so the concept of a punchline- ie something worth waiting for, is lost.
But then again, some people might like being hectored into conformity. I don’t."
Ladies like lamb too,"Lee Lin Chin for PM. Luckily she’s so rad, as she seems to be the only woman who likes lamb. In the entire universe."
Tez,"Thanks everyone involved in making it or working for the companies that made it for sharing your comments above, but the bar would have to have officially fallen to the floor for such a piece of work to be considered quality."
Boomerang?,Isn’t it pretty offensive to slaughter a country’s native people and then use their language and culture to commemorate the day and sell meat.
Dani White,"Well done, Monkeys. Exceptional!"
C,I was expecting to see the start of a great integrated campaign that would reach every Aussies and make them proud. But instead the story falls short with an average TVC. Such a shame.
pseudonym,"From Lamb to Lame in 5 seconds, well done Monkeys for ruining another aussie ‘brand’ Bring the old Sam back…
@C you’re so damn right, the line suggest something bigger and better then a 30’TVC very underwhelming finding out it’s all it is."
educate yo'self,"@C & @ psuedonym perhaps you missed reading the bit about the integrated campaign including…
‘The Nova Network’s Fitzy & Wippa show… the hosts are showing their commitment to the Operation Boomerang theme by airing from London throughout the first week, and seeking out overseas Australians to be flown home for Australia Day and a lamb BBQ.’
Well done Monkeys and everyone who worked on it! You have set the bar high for the year ahead."
pseudonym,@educate yo’self: Meh!
Monkey see monkey do,"This is a bad ripp off of 72 and Sunny’s extraction ad.
Look it up – it’s way more entertaining than this"
Flaming hell,"Look, I’m vegan and can usually take a gentle joke at my expense but flaming the vegan’s Brooklyn apartment was going a bit far one would have thought?"
Great work,https://vimeo.com/84736058
@Great work,ugh…   must we do this in every comment section…
@ Flaming hell,No
vegans,"@flaming hell
I think he’s torching a salad by the look of it"
@5:11pm,"Ughh indeed. It’s not every comments section. This is a direct lift from a previous campaign that was well known in the industry.
If the monkeys had done this say once or twice you could call it ‘coincidence’. But the monkeys seem to do it an awful lot.
Just off the top of my head;
Ship song, welcome to the jungle / there will be stories, sun sound…
Anyone else care to add here?
Everyone else can come up with their own ideas, why can’t the monkeys?"
Dear MLA,Give it back to BMF
COD piece,"The biggest shame about this is they have a great Aussie brand, seemingly decent budget, massive celebrity pulling power and a client who in his words is really keen on ‘brave creativity’.
And for whatever reason the director and agency have decided to do an almost shot-for-shot poor man’s version of CODNapped.
http://www.businessinsider.com/call-of-dutys-codnapped-2014-1?IR=T
Good clients deserve better work than that."
The Force,"Forced “Aussie” humour.
Really cheesy ad.
However, it’s great the agency likes it so much!"
CODFISH,"@codpiece
They both couldn’t have possibly borrowed from a few decades of action films could they? Some of us watch things other than commercials."
New AD Guy,Loved the torching of the vegan belongings. nice work dudes.
Nauru,Was that militant Australian forces actually rushing people back into and over the country’s borders to eat meat on a day that commemorates indigenous genocide ? Really ? Wow … just … wow.
@CODFISH,"That’s interesting mate, are you enjoying working there?
It’s not like it’s the first time the monkeys have ripped something almost scene for scene. Sure, this uses celebrities and different scenarios, but it’s identical in structure.
Set up with a VO, show a few vignettes, then out.
Identical."
@CODFISH,"Music is amazingly similar too.
If you’re going to copy either make it subtle (steal) or super obvious (parody). Otherwise you just look like a monkey."
phuck you,"99% of Australian’s have never seen the inside of an abattoir , if they did they wouldn’t be eating this shit"
overcooked lamb,Bit of a rip off but the first 5 seconds was great.
@codpiece,"I agree, neither are an original idea. You have to admit it’s not the first time a faux-military mission theme has been used in advertising.
Both suffer from the same generic structure (briefing/montage/conclusion) but then again it is short form so I’m not sure what the alternative would be."
Old CD Guy,Oh stop your petty quibbling. It’s pathetic (the quibbling). The ad?…it’s pretty good I guess.
