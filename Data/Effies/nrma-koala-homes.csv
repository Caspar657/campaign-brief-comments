Ouch...,… my feelings.
Something in my eye.,"The result of when Monkeys get together with Koalas.
Absolutely stunning.
Beautifully told, beautifully executed."
Teary McTearface,"This
Is
Lovely."
Pseu Don Nym,Huge of them to get the licence to Hans Zimmer’s Man of Steel score. Big get. Well done.
Nice.,Lovely work.  One tree seems a bit stingy though.  Can’t you plant a tree for about 10c?
Yep,Such a wonderful piece of film making.
Boring McBored face,This is dull
Blinky,"Best film from Australia in a long time.
Freedman plus Monkey magic."
Fonzie,Title for your next book of comments:
Hey NRMA...,Lovely ad but surely you could do more than ONE tree for every policy?
NRMA customer,Please tell me this isn’t true?
ailes,"Great piece of film.
Just take off the tiny disclaimer ‘Until Dec 31, 2019’."
Yes.,"I love this.
To those who are complaining that NRMA should be doing more for Koalas beyond planting one tree for every policy, I kinda of  agreed but then I thought what is my insurance company actually doing? Absolutely nothing. Apart from trying to sell me a product or renew stuff.
This is a bold move from an Insurer.
Well played."
I’m not crying,You’re crying
Credit,"Nice job, enjoyed it"
@Hey NRMA and @NRMA customer,“NRMA Insurance has entered a three-year partnership with Conservation Volunteers Australia to plant as many koala homes as possible across Queensland and New South Wales.”
1 tree for 1 policy?,"Really? Surely 1 Policy in paper terms takes a lot of trees.
What if NRMA pledged to make their policies paperless and donate more than one tree?"
Ricci,Lovely.  Great to see community work that links directly to brand promise.
Mr Bear,"People will like this, and that’s all that matters."
@Hey NRMA and @NRMA customer,I think you missed the point. 
Not Koalified to comment,Awesome initiative. Save the homes of the cutest Australians. 
flip it,How about NRMA put their money where the mouth is and give out a year’s insurance for everyone who plants a tree? Are all those Conservation Volunteers going to get discounted rates?
Nique,Um… a little bioy climbing up a power pole…exactly the message an insurance company should send out.. and how did you get that koala up there ?
Where is the magic,That had room to be a really beautiful story and fell flat for me.
meh,"I mean, I get the emotional manipulation they were going for but this left me feeling cold. And took a long time in doing it as well."
Brill,Well done Gary Freedman and Monkeys. Made me get all warm and fuzzy inside. I love it.
fury cutie,"I like it but it feels like it is missing something
Well done though to all involved and well shot"
Slow burn,"Did he drop the Koala in a burnt out forrest?
This is what you should really do if you see a native animal in trouble. "
hmmm,"Great client initiative, rubbish ad."
Not good at all.,Buy an insurance policy and we’ll plant a tree…or in marketing terms a Koala home. Sad idea on all fronts.
omg,please please please no more god dam tinkering spacial pianos pleeeeeeasae…
Uh oh,"@ Not Koalified, you sound like a partner sucking up to your clients arse. Little transparent. A little bitter. Get back to that thing you do, whatever that is.
Nice work NRMonkeys."
Caramello,Not really warm or fuzzy.  Hope that koala is getting rollovers from the last spot he shot with NRMA.
Yeah right,"Cause related marketing is morally dubious at best. Perhaps if the company tackled an issue that was related to its existence we could commend them for trying to “make the world a better place” and not just make money. For example, a motoring brand like NRMA here wanting to advance its ESG credentials, might look at electric vehicle takeup, cycling safety, or congestion issues. Too often though, as is the case with this ad, the company chooses an issue that is safe ground and totally remote from its activities, then hijacks people’s goodwill to gain some brand benefit. Judging by the comments here it looks people are still well and truly sucked in by this tactic."
koala-ty,Well done Gary and The Monkeys
,You know who will like this ad? Nanas.
!,"Jeez, you know who writes and complains about ads like you? Nanas.
A brand tries to do something good and you complain about it. Time to go change your adult diaper."
,"@!, give it a bone. This brand is not trying to do something good. They’re trying to APPEAR like they are doing something good. There’s a massive effing difference, and it’s as obvious as your involvement with the campaign."
Joanne tabone,"everytime I seen these ads featuring Arlo it just pulls so hard on my heart…..we all should be doing so much more to protect these beautiful creatures as well as this beautiful habitat that we have all inherited!   We all can make a difference and it does not always have to come from the wallet/purse ……learning and teaching our generation and those to come how to better co exist with our environment and with all creatures great and small.
Thankyou"
