Anonymous,Brilliant idea. Love it.
Anonymous,WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?!
Anonymous,"Hardly revolutionary – shavers have the strip telling you to change it, other products have the equivalent.
Doesn’t feel like a creative territory, just an obvious strategic one."
Anonymous,"Do you hide the cost of the award video in the budget, or are you upfront about it?"
Anonymous,The simplicity of this is what makes it brilliant. I am very jealous. Great work.
Anonymous,Zzzzzzzzzzzzz.
Anonymous,Are those living things in your pillow happy soldiers?
jen,Clever. I’m throwing all my pillows out when I get home. thanks for that.
Anonymous,"Big idea. Solid, simple executions. And will make you buy the product much more often than you would otherwise…..sly bastards.
Award video needs some work though."
JK,Habit changing work. Brilliant. Why do creatives moan about this type of work? Shame on you. This is the kind of work that works and the kind of clever thinking we should all be trying to do. 11.31 and 11.58 you make me sad for your existence in this industry.
Anonymous,Fantastic. Surely one of the best examples of an idea (versus an ad campaign) in some time.
Anonymous,"brilliant, envious. great idea."
Anonymous,"Bloody brilliant! Both the work and the comment from JK
Suck it up!!"
A²,"Such a simple concept, yet completely brilliant! The idea is what is genius here, not the ads in particular. I bet you it will translate into increased sales in the brand.
11:58 > Your comment was zzzzzzzzzzzzz. I guess that shows the extent of your creative ability when the best comment you can come up with is zzzzzzzzzzzzzz.
11:31 > Yes, it must be an obvious strategy considering nobody has thought of it until now.
11:25 > It really is simple. They put a use by date on your pillow so, like food, once it has reached the use by date you should throw it out and replace it with a new one
So sick of the haters on this blog who, by their own comments, show that they have no idea whatsoever.
Have to agree with 12:37 though, your award video needs some work."
Anonymous,"so let me get this right. the client wants to let people know their pillows get skanky after a while and these guys come up with a ‘use by’ stamp, then make a documentary about it???
yawn…i need a pillow after seeing this."
Anonymous,I just want one of Jen’s pillows.
Anonymous,"“Honey our Tontine pillow is out of date.”
“Ok let’s go with another brand this time, they last longer.”"
Anonymous,"What happens if, by the time you buy it, it’s already a year old?
The stamp should be put on at purchase, not manufacture."
Anonymous,"But 5:04, the closer you are to the use by date when you buy it means the quicker Tontine gets you to buy another pillow!!
Makes more sense to have a use by date for matresses. At least they have to be built to order so the use by date is relevant"
Anonymous,Wash your fucking pillows pussies.
Mr Official,"Official score: 3.75/5* (this feels to me like it will educate the market well, even inspire many to throw out their current pillow and remember that they don’t last indefinitely. I just don’t think the natural conclusion will be to necessarily buy a whatever brand of pillow this campaign is for.)"
Anonymous,"Like someone has said, if this is getting lauded, does that mean the guy who came up with the coloured bristles on toothbrushes that fade indicating you need a new one deserves some credit? Or whoever put the fading coloured strip on razors?"
Anonymous,"very smart strategy to get people to buy more of your product. a seemingly obvious solution, but those are often the best."

Hey, Jen, are you really that fucking susceptible to advertising? Dear me, you must be absolutely skint after every time you switch on the tv."
Anonymous,"‘Australians don’t change their pillows often enough.
Because they are unaware of what grows inside them over time.’
This sentence doesn’t make any sense.
Also, are we supposed to submit our award entry films now, not the actual ads that were produced for tv?
Hilarious how the entire viewing public is portrayed watching the Tontine ads with open mouthed disbelief because the Happy Soldiers message is so powerful. Well done.
My guess is the real viewing experience was somewhat different."
Jen,"Dear Anonymous (10.06am),
Don’t slag me off you rude prick. Or at least have the guts to put your name to it. And no I’m not skint. I’m rolling in it and I can afford new pillows every week if I want them. You must be a very bitter person if you come on this blog to attack people you clearly don’t know. Thank God I had a good night’s sleep on my new pillow last night or I’d be much more pissed off than this.
I’ve got to go answer the door, my Ab Master Pro has just arrived and I’ve only got 30 days to see if I’m satisfied."
Anonymous,"Jen wins best copywriter on this thread.
ps: very clever business solution by the Soldiers. If you can’t appreciate that then you probably shouldn’t be in the business of selling stuff."
Anonymous,"I don’t give a fuck about the microscopic thingies living in my pillow, because like all human beings, I’ve got millions of weirdass microscopic monsters living in my skin.
I also know that dust is predominantly dead skin cells. And that, at a microscopic level at least, we are living in filth every second of our lives.
So Tontine doesn’t scare me into buying more of their stuff. Might work on the gullible though."
Anonymous,"Agreed, it is a clever business solution by the ‘Soldiers’.
Now, if only they could produce an ad to go with it that was any way near as interesting."
Anonymous,over produced award video.
Anonymous,Wash and leave in sun for the whole day.??
