Fen,Nice idea,Reply
Jonno,That’s pretty cool,Reply
mondo,"I like the idea of building a car with randon bits, but can’t help but feel the idea doesn’t belong to the brand.
I mean I really like it in some ways and it’s original, but something doesn’t quite slot together nicely for me.",Reply
Sub Woofer,Very interesting idea I think.,Reply
Smokin Joe,This looks good – just in time for Cannes,Reply
Nice!,"Not as nice as the IKEA car tho!

Mondo mondo,"I don’t know about not feeling like the brand – I mean this is streets ahead of the unworry stuff – at least it has a point.
Building a car out of the other insurance companies gotchas is pretty sweet.
This is much better than the other ad posted last week.
I likey",Reply
Fairness,"Creative and Artistic Direction by the Glue Society.
So is it Whybin or Glue? Talk about stealing thunder.",Reply
Yo yo ma,"I can’t help but think there are some good albeit opposing ideas fighting to get to the forefront. On the one hand, you’ve got ‘extras aren’t extras with NRMA’, but then  getting to ‘you choose the extras and we’ll build a car’ feels like more of an expert mechanic angle.
It doesn’t feel like a logical link, but maybe i’m just talking shit.",Reply
JS,"Cool, different  idea for insurance.",Reply
SpareParts,So Whybin/TBWA had noth’n to do with it then. Glue as creative?,Reply
Search & Destroy,Yellow Treehouse on wheels perhaps?,Reply
seriously,"Smokin Joe, Cannes? really? with what comes out of your mouth people probably look forward to your farts.",Reply
Giant Paper Clips,"Whatever happens the award entry film will show this to be a triumphant, nationwide success.",Reply
not that different for car insurance...,Something similar was done for Just Car Insurance.,Reply
Seriously cannes,"A quick google search shows whybins won at Cannes for another nrma campaign and this one looks a better idea so why not.
And nrma are a NSW brand so don’t think they show the campaign to be a national success. If you’re going to be pithy, at least do some research",Reply
Gladys,"Yup, pay that, good going.",Reply
DJ AD MAD,Props to the whybin nu schoolerz.,Reply
Paul,It’s basically a rip off of an extremely famous photograph. But it’s done nicely by nice guys.,Reply
To paul,"How is building a car out of parts that aren’t insured by other insurers a rip off of a photograph?
Perhaps for the art direction of the first tv – but this style has been used on many things.
I think the idea is in a whole other level.",Reply
Insider,The idea was by Tammy Keegan and Craig Brooks. No Glue involved.,Reply
