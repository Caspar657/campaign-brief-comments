Anonymous,"Wow.
This is the most original strategy I have ever seen for an anti-speeding project.
I watched every second of the ad and was completely taken in.
Congratulations. Brilliant.
P.S. Has someone been reading ‘The Power of Now’?"
Anonymous,"Goodness, that’s a long ad.
I didn’t have time to watch it all, because I’m too busy speeding through life.
I stopped it at the bit where the woman dunks her head in the bath that she recently made a poo in."
Anonymous,"I’m hoping that this is just the launch of a new campaign thought, cause I do like the idea behind it. Slow the fuck down, what’s the rush.
But it’s an awfully long expression of that idea. Really overwritten and crammed with way too much unnecessary info.
Please do something more with the idea, cause it’s a goodie. If this is all that comes out of it, then you’ve missed a trick guys."
Anonymous,Is there poop in her bathwater?
Anonymous,"The VO says ‘slot into a groove’, and at the same time, we show a record on a record player.
Wow.
But the bit about the breathing is my favorite. I mean, when last did you really breath? No, REALLY breath?"
Anonymous,Slow in making its point too.

Anonymous,"Bravo on a unique strategy.
Personally I’m sick to death of being assailed by the TAC with finger-wagging guilt trips, nightmarish crash scenes and dead kids walking the streets.
This is good. But the execution lets the idea down IMO. It’s a bit laboured. As 4.51 says, they’ve definitely got something here that’s bigger and more profound than this particular execution."
Anonymous,like that the “Authorised by…” bit at the end was slow too. Nice touch.
J,lovely g-string at 9 seconds
Greidy,"Lovely.
Wouldn’t like to pay for the media though."
TF,Thank fuck for that. About time too.
Chainey,Jealous. That’s ‘paradigm-shifting’ stuff as my Planning Director likes to say.
Rog,"That’s one beautiful journey from the drum kit, Al."
Anonymous,nice. I like this. Great VO.
Anonymous,"For real?
I mean, seriously, for real?
Paradigm shifting stuff?
Are you all out of your fucking minds?
This is not just awful, it’s godawful. It is long, drawn out, laboured, over written, over produced dog shit.
Good god people, get your heads out of your arses for just a second and look at it. Seriously."
Anonymous,"And seriously, why does it look like she poo’d in the water?"
Tom,"Waish I thought of that.
I guess it does go for a while….but isn’t that the point in slowing down?
Website is cool too! Love the interviews."
Anonymous,Dull and overlong.
Anonymous,"Brilliant idea, but FFS cut it down so people other than us ad wankers might actually watch it."
Emma,"It’s been up for 2 days and already has 4,600 views on youtube."
Will Think For Salary,"Hey, thanks for watching.
AND taking the time to respond.
Feel better?"
Anonymous,That’s a long fucking ad. I’m running late now and will have to put my foot down!
Anonymous,This would work brilliantly as cinema where you have a captive audience looking to be taken along for a ride.
Anonymous,"I really liked this, I think it’s beautifully written with a great strategy. I do find it ironic that it comes from the ad industry, one of the most fast paced stressful businesses around. I can guarantee if the folks who came up with that concept took their own advice and slowed down, they’d get fired."
Anonymous,"7.15
You obviously have never met Rich Berney."
Anonymous,"Interesting strategy, although I suspect those who speed most are least likely to connect with it.
But lordy… the execution.
Ye gods.
One single shot over 30 seconds. Or even better 60. No VO. A super.
That’s all it needed."
Anonymous,"12.53 – I have a feeling I may be the audience, and to be honest it did resonate with me.
I’m one of those people that (I’ll probably get shouted down for it) who believes that driving above an arbitrary, government-prescribed speed limit is not necessarily dangerous in itself, and that the focus should be shifted to driver education, car maintenance & driving to the conditions (which may mean doing 40km/h in what is now a 60km/h zone, or 150km/h in what is currently an 80km/h zone).  Think Germany.
Anyway, the only response the current strategy every government the world over uses – shock advertising coupled with the use of reven…sorry “safety” cameras – gets from me is one of frustration/anger.  I just want to kick the TV in.  Especially given it has precisely zero impact on the road toll.
This, however, made me stop & think a bit."
Anonymous,"I couldn’t be bothered watching ’til the end, but it is a new, and interesting strategy. Slow down. Enjoy the ride. It contains a human truth. I have to say I like the message, even if I was bored shitless by the actual ad. There is a certain age guys reach when we do not feel the need to risk our necks and others’  when we get into a car. This strategy – and maybe this ad – could speak to them at that point."
