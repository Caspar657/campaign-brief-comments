This is so far behind the AFL it’s embarrassing.
Get your shit together NRL.
You’re letting the game down.",Reply
Oops...,https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=32&r=g,"I think someone accidentally stuck a key-number on the hype reel.
1. It’s such a visceral and emotive game it should be easy as piss to write to.
2. Your strategy is showing. And it’s a weak one.
FFS spend a bit of dough on a decent track (this comes across as the poor-man’s Tina Turner) and use the best parts of the game that makes it awesome: big-hit-porn.",Reply

Footy fan,https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=32&r=g,"Exciting new edge??? Such crap. NRL wake the fark up
This is your worst ad/campaign ever.",Reply
Gary Magpie,https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=32&r=g,"This campaign is the best TVC that rugby league has put together, ever. Tina Turner’s two were also obviously great but the 2013 promotion went beyond the premiership to the backyard and the mothers’ club. And anyone who knows anything about rugby league’s growth  (or lack thereof) knows that the problem is not with getting mature age males in Sydney to tune in, it is with getting families to love the game. This ad bridges the gap more than any year before has even tried and there is no doubt it works. Jess brings NRL credibility to young and female demographics. The vision is realistic in many homes but this is where growth starts. And wrapped up in some of the best CGI on aussie TV. Well done NRL!",Reply
