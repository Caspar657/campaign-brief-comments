Buzz,The best AFL ad since the one I did.
Big Bad Barry,Cummins Melbs are doing some good things
Pumped,Pretty cool ad. Gave me tingles. Nicely done.
Well,"I like the thought of this,  but I honestly find it a bit flat. I don’t feel anticipation about the season. I think there was more anticipation about last night’s Footy Show."
Howboutit,KOOTA TVC
Al,Love it Trent. Stunning!
Bill Board,Solid idea brilliantly executed.
Fans!,I’m so pumped to go see other fans cheering! That’s why I go to the footy. To watch fans! FANS! CARN THE FANS!!
@ Big Bad Barry,"Mate, you obviously work there. Newsflash for you – Cummins Melbs aren’t doing any particularly good things. This isn’t that good, nor is that Jeep promo thingy, nor is anything else they’ve produced recently.
Lots of new business, still no work."
Old CD Guy,"Brilliant production, corny, flat finish."
Flying door mat,Easily the best AFL ad since A League Of Its Own. Well done
Strong,They’re a good agency. And Doritos was good. So what more do you expect?
Kool,No agency drinks Kool Aid as potent as these guys. The latest “MADC Event” is further evidence
Yep,"Very ordinary. No emotion, no connection with an amazing game."
From the members end,"Good.Yep.
Clever production.
Great?
Nah…. It’s the footy, not the fans.
But I guess AF is all over it.
‘Real history of AFL’ was better…that one with the different sports in it- better.
“I’d like to see that!” – better."
clarity,"@strong… I would expect the ad to get me excited about the upcoming season and tap into what happens ON THE FIELD rather than bore me with a retrospective of fans waving flags. Why would I pay to go and see that? Also, just be clear on exactly what role C&P played in the Doritos ad…"
We are Australian,Flat as s tack.
Pumped,I got shivers in the Leo Barry bit. I reckon this is great!
"Julia, 13","Yup, the fans make the game."
Oh dear,"@clarity Cummins roll in the Doritos is clear. They wrote the ad.
Also I think with sporting code launches there is an understanding he networks will show a bucket load of sporting images so the agencies challenge is to look for other ways to add excitement. Or meet the challenges of the code.
Also you seem like a dick.
Impartial observer."
like,"ffsake – let’s have a dig again at someone attempting to do something  semi-watchable. this is beautifully produced and as an AFL fan – it resonated with me.  No I don’t work for cummins and tbh, I couldn’t give a shit which agency it came from. In a climate where beer ads have gone to shit and timid clients are rife, we should be celebrating any attempt at something creative, not panning it. This ad is v well done, on point, and better than 99% of the crap you’ll get served on your tv screen next time you switch it on."
Footy fan,"Don’t tell me something, make me feel something. This has no genuine emotion whatsoever and goes to the heart of Cummins work, executions with little understanding of what gets to people. ‘You make the game’ – thank you AFL, really?"
Tom G,A clever ad with good use of insight.. Very smart. Well done AFL and C&P
@@Big Bad Barry,"Nah I don’t, I do like the work the are doing but going by your comments your work is probably a lot better."

@Like this,"Oh yes, that’s much better of course. It’s English."
The truth,Stock footage ad with a lame strategy and terribly corny ending.
Bon Snott,"I’m surprised they could afford that. Looks like the production people made a lot out of not much money. Good on them for that.
I can tell they got asked to change the voice over. “More positive.”"
Bang Bang Bang,"Huge client, tonne of money, Hollywood director, top production company and they still couldn’t get it right. Australian advertising is in a butt-load of trouble."
Catters,Looks amazing but doesnt exactly get you pumped up for the season.
@@Like this,"Yeah, let’s defend a well worn strategy when it’s true, blue Aussie"
Skinner,The best AFL ad in ages. Hats off.
Under the thumb,I feel sorry for the agency who clearly had this ridiculous approach pushed on them by marketers at the AFL who have no idea what they are doing. Terrible. One star.
Hits_the_post,"This ad is pretty good… up until the ending. The parts written by commentators work, while the parts written by the agency is *yawn* boring. Completely ruins the excellent build up. It’s like watching a footy sail through the air only to hit the post. Visually the ad is great – the travelling through time and the effect work well. Such a shame about the ending."
Wings,Interesting that the Essendon fans are shown with the Last Post. In memory of the death of their club’s reputation perhaps?
