Hmm,No credits
wow,that is a shocker.
KWPee,What a load of bollocks SATC …. this was a bad call and advert …. let be honest about that and move on
Haha,I’d cry like that also if I thought about how much time and money I’d wasted going to Adelaide…
Bad,Just about the worst ad I’ve ever seen.
BADelaide,AMIRITE?!
Amateur hour,S&*T
trash,unfortunately for TBWA this is one they’ll wish they hadn’t made. it’s utter trash.
Jam.,"TBWA,anything to say?"
Tim,The client ad whoever put this idea up at TBWA should resign now. That’s just appalling. KWP must be laughing so hard.
KWP legacy,"You trashed the legacy of good tourism campaigns built by KWP… this is the ‘who weekly’ version of their ‘Stephen king novel’. You average marketing people, and culturally tone deaf TBWA Melbourne, probably did the idea from their office in South Melbourne without even visiting the place. Yeah SA might not be New York, or even Melbourne for that matter, but it deserves better than this utter sh*t smear."
Not from SA,I saw this on the weekend with my kids.  We all laughed and immediately talked about it – in a good way. Yep it’s polarised people – but when was the last time South Australia ever got so much attention?  I’m betting visitation spikes.
Not from SA,"I saw this on the weekend with my kids. We all looked at each other in amazement and said what the hell was that?? Then discussed what a mean-spirited, misguided waste of money it was."
Reality check,"There’s attempted controversy and then there is this. The aim is humour, it falls short, dull and depressing is the net effect."
Victoria square conversations...,Can you imagine all the conversations convincing each that this was still a good idea to do…statements like….
rubbish,rubbish
John Mills,"As an old and ex advertising man, this would surely put off younger people from visiting SA. It portrays a place that is only for oldies. Obviously the reverse of what they had in mind. The client says they wanted to be controversial, bullshit, that’s not controversial just misguided."
visit victoria/nsw/adelaide. stay home.,"Starts on ‘old mate’ wandering through Melbourne Botanic Gardens, cut to him on bus to Yarra Valley winery, cut to him  climbing onto roof of MCG or AAMI stadium.
Or is it,
Starts on ‘old mate’ wandering through Sydney Botanic Gardens, cut to him on bus to Hunter Valley winery, cut to him  climbing onto roof of olympic/SCG/ stadium."
Big T,"This rocked. I was in a bar with all my friends and we saw it and everyone burst out laughing and did a standing ovation.
The only people who don’t like this ad are boomers who constantly complain about millennials because they remind them about their own mortality. Not me though, I’m part of the Lost Generation, we rocked. Also Gen X are boomers and so are some millennials and zoomers. This is the ad you all wish you could make but you’re too busy writing crap poetry over getty stock footage to rub a client’s ego because we all know advertising sucks and the only way to make it better is to write some bizarre ad about a lonely dude. Any reply to this post just validates my point."
who,Who directed this?
@Tim,That’s not very nice.
Kel,"Come on TBWA,at least stand by your work."
Panick stations,They were meant to release another version yesterday. But pulled it at last second. 
Killing it...,"A boring live stream launch ‘stunt’ that no-one saw or cared about, followed up with one of the worst ads I’ve ever seen… SATC and TBWA are absolutely nailing this new partnership."
Cruel AND boring,"My partner fell critically ill while we were holidaying overseas. After a year long illness he died recently. Our next holiday was a the around Australia jaunt…I guess I’m the old mate you are exploiting. I can see the Big T and the SA Tourist Commission having a bit a chuckle at my expense.
No doubt, I will get to my around Australia holiday after I’ve reassembled my life. But, “Thanks SA Tourist Commission. You’ve saved me some time. I’ve no need to go to Adelaide. It’s to f**king boring.”"
Hijack Brief,Alright folks let’s focus on the big news in league this week!
Boring Old Mate,Surely this old mate could have found some more fun things to do in Adelaide than eat an ice cream on a pier or go to the botanic gardens. If thats all there’s to do in Adelaide then it’s perfectly suited for old mates.
don't get it at all.,"Sorry, but why is this meant to be controversial, i really don’t understand. Seems very straight to me."
What a downfall...,"They’ve gone from some iconic and beautiful work you can hold your head high about (Barossa Nick Cave) with trusted local Adelaide creative talent, and shifted it all to Melbourne so they can get very below average work instead? Disaster."
Entitled Millenial,"This genuinely got a chuckle out of me. Mean-spirited, weird, delightful. Give me this any day over another dull as dishwater state tourism hype reel. "
Settle down folks,"I don’t know what the big deal is here, everyone’s taking it too seriously – which seems to be a problem in advertising at the moment. It’s a light hearted little gag. It made me laugh when he cried. Lighten up nerds."
Twaddle Pump,"Oh my, what a mess.
Maybe TBWA should fly to Adelaide and apologise to SATC.
Oh, hang  on, I guess they’re on their way to NYC to talk about saving the world by putting some logos on a few sails."
oh well,The good news? Tourism SA account will soon be up for pitch
Young mate,I don’t think ‘Old Mate’ has ever been used to describe someone that’s actually old.
Sigh,"Mustn’t be a lot to do in Adelaide, judging by the amount of hate-fuelled comments on here."
misdeirected,SA has some beautiful cemeteries
Generation defining work,"Truly the ad the defined a generation. People will look back on Australian advertising history, and amongst the glory of George Patterson, Mojo and will sit this magnificent piece by TBWA Melbourne for SA Tourism. It makes me proud to work in the industry, and confident that m̶y̶ this agency has got what it takes to be amongst the best in the world. Brava!"
Oh Nooooooooo,A few logo’s on a sail and now this SH*T. This will be up for pitch in 3 months.
TK,This would make more sense being an ad for RSVP than for Adelaide Tourism.
feel sorry for . . .,. . . SATC
Surely I'm not the only one reminded of this,https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=60&v=-p1z2D-A4iY
Tex Walker,Geez mate! That is so embarrassing I have decided to step down as captain of the Adelaide Crows.
Movie Buff,Is he Brooks from the Shawshank Redemption? Riding the bus too.
Robert Heath,TV is low involvement processing.
wow,Great insight!
