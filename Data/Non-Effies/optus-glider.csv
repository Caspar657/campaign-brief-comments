Reg,"In case you didn’t understand our convoluted story, we’ve explained the entire ad in the press release."
bobthebuilder,huh?
Love love love,This made the cockles of mi heart warm. Beautifully done.
Rewind,I have absolutely no idea what’s going on here. The glider got the girl an iPhone for Xmas?
Lovely animation,The moment with the glider above the air vent is a winner
Dog's Dinner,"‘This is the latest iteration of the acclaimed “It Starts With Yes” platform’
Acclaimed by who exactly? It’s a dog’s dinner of an idea that gets more strained and convoluted with each new commercial."
Repeat viewing...,"… necessary.
I think we may just have forgotten what advertising is, Optus."
But what,Nope that makes absolutely no sense at all. I wanted to read it as the possums are moving out because theres a new baby. But nope. I get so confused.
Hm,"Was really great until they did the the *record scratch*, *two weeks earlier* trope. I know they did this with the last one too and it just feels lazy."
Says it all,"‘We then reverse back to the moment of ‘yes’ that inspired these ambitious events – pinpointing the moment where our glider decided to turn optimism into action by starting a family of his own.’
This needs to be a super on screen"
It all starts with John Lewis,Optus tries to emulate famous Christmas campaign but forgets the simple art of storytelling.
The Awful Truth,"Lovely production, but what the hell is the story?"
Noah,Who cares if it makes any kind of sense – they’ve brought the animals back!
Cute,The sugar glider is a better actor than any of the humans
A child is born,"After 4 viewings I understand now…
The sugar gliders artificially inseminated a human baby by collecting sperm samples during the night. It’s Christmas miracle."
Glidin',"Dad glider looks at mum glider.
Mum glider looks back.
Dad glider nods.
Mum glider: “Let’s bang.”"
Long form narrative,"Can often be hard for us ad ppl.
No RTBs, CTAs or WTF."
Mel Hopkins,"Hey crew –
As ever appreciate feedback from the creative community and love constructive feedback.
One ask to the above who have been rather brutal – please share with me at Melissa.hopkins@optus.com.au your latest work in market. Honestly keen to understand if you are producing great work or just throwing stones at anything ?"
Hank Mardukas,"How do you dingbats not get this? Everyone knows the gestation period for a sugar glider is 17 days.
Lovely work. The air vent moment made me lol IRL."
Average Creative,"You don’t need a body of great work to recognise when something is over complicated. If it’s too convoluted to understand in the relative quiet of an online blog, what chance do the viewing public have when it’s buried in the noise of an ad break? Time will tell of course, and we could all be talking nonsense. Good luck with it."
Confused,Not an easy get.
I'm not a chef,"But I can discern whether a restaurant meal is decent or not.
Echoing @average creative, if the work is complicated, that is not an opinion, that’s a fact, shared by many."
Tom,"Mel, I’d like to believe opinions can count with having experience, a body of work is only part of that."
Tom D (Donald),"Someone just texted me to ask why I’m arguing with Mel Hopkins about an Optus ad on here. That Tom is not me.
The ad is fine. Everyone go do something actually useful with your lives. x"
Melissa Hopkins,"My last post on this matter.
At the end of the day the consumers will make the call and that is what is important.
I love constructive feedback and care deeply about the Aussie creative community. You are all entitled to your opinions – but as I ask above please share your latest work with me at Melissa.hopkins@optus.com.au Getting great work out is hard….sadly the commentary above seems to make it sound super easy. So please send me the great work !!!"
Ollie,"Where does one start with this?!
It is a story that to the average joe, literally doesn’t make sense / isn’t easily understood. total fail.
mary and bob from the ‘burbs don’t want to have to work hard to work out the meaning of an advert.
seriously, who signs this off?!
probably the same people who spend most of the day on LinkedIn self promoting / patting themselves on the back for how amazing they are / how “loved” they want to be – hot tip: consumers don’t “love” service based / utilities companies – so stop deluding yourselves.
they need (yet) another change at the top, deluded, self important marketers steering the ship into the ground.
also, slightly weird that the premise of the work is about protecting a vulnerable Aussie species, yet a Kiwi agency produced the work. again, reeks of self indulgent BS
AGAIN, you’ll never be the market leader, so quit trying and quit pretending like people care about a non-tangible service"
Carol Brimson,Absolutely beautiful. Very cute and very family oriented xxx
Rin 75,"I wondered about the premise and meaning of this ad but after watching it a couple of times I get it. I mean watching it for the first time I was left scratching my head thinking “Who makes these ads, this makes absolutely no sense and what do possums and the rest have to do with telecommunications? Turns out its quite a simple message."
Rin 75,The little possum is scavenging to provide for his expectant family. Turn back time 14 days before and he’s exchanging questioning looks with his possum wife and she gives him the nod. Ahhhh yep the penny dropped after a few watches. It all starts with YES. Hence the scavenging at the beginning of the ad. Its really sweet and cute when You understand it.
Danni Sparkes,"Not a quick get, few branding issues (no Optus mentioned until 56 seconds into a 60 spot), but the track choice is sensational and caught my attention (hello cut through!).
A challenging script to build connection to the product itself, could be a costly mistake, but perhaps this is the start of the same vibe as the hyped John Lewis seasonal TVC campaigns. Warm and fuzzy. I’m also pleased they have not produced another homogeneous covid / pandemic / ‘we’re open again’ campaign. BORING.
In future campaigns if they keep using the track, the possums (?!) and already strong tagline, they might’ve built themselves a nice little suite of new distinctive brand assets!
If the content can better connect to the brand and be unmistakably Optus throughout the spot, it will at least function as an ad without anyone needing to comprehend the storyline. This will at least yield positive results for long term brand health tracking.
The upside is that this could better function as a piece of online content, where there is more time to take in the storyline and recognise that the ad is for Optus.
Want to see more from this agency/client partnership!!"
Tony,"No mention of the singer/song writer
DAVID GATES of BREAD"
Gary K,Well done….. A wonderful ad…… Up there with the Cadbury.
Jackal,The baby looks fake???? Is it just me?
PPAL,Brilliant
