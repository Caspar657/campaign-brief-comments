"I’ve been working in advertising for many years.
In that time, I have longed to use the headline ‘Enjoy the view.’
And now I’m gutted that something like this has turned up.
It’s all in the crafting.
It’s the way that the product takes up the entire page, almost shattering convention. It’s the cunning use of stock photography and the beautiful, poetic use of a huge fucking bird that just nails it.
It just nails what wine is all about. Huge cities, Asia and birds.
Congratulations to the client, the agency and Getty Images for a wonderful, groundbreaking piece of art.",Nob,Reply
Why use stock shots from the 90’s?,WTF,Reply
"Nob 2:17 your cracking me up here, hilarious.
This is groundbreaking, take wine they want to sell to blokes, make look like Johnny walker or chivas as much as possible, then stick a big fucking bird on there. I think they should enter this to Cannes, just for the giggle.",macca,Reply
Vintrepreneur?,You do what?,Reply
"Why does DDB Melbourne consistently pr wallpaper and seriously average work?
The account service must love working there.
Perhaps they even do the creative too.",Why do they bother?,Reply
"Of all the things I associate Wolf Blass with it ain’t a fucking bird.
What’s next, a mountain backdrop with a wolf in the background?
How about selling the fact that it’s a decent drop (well the Grey label stuff is anyway).",Ben,Reply
