honest,Did all the data and research you’ve collected point to the fact that the 7-Eleven target demographic loves really shite ads?
All that was needed,For 7/11 the brand and for 7/11customer – all that’s needed is the last 10 secs.
Cheap TV,"Spelling error. Missing the A.
But true to form."
Raised eyebrows,“We wanted the launch of our My 7-Eleven App to be a memorable brand moment..” 
Wake up and smell the $1 coffee,"This is an ad for a rewards app – it nails that brief. Really fun, catchy stuff."
Hard time for musicians,"Client Liaison must really be struggling with the lack of performance revenue if they agreed to do this, very off brand partnership for them."
Yeah OK...,It’s flogging free stuff. It’s made fun.
pugwash,"but its a lame tune, even for them"
Leoscrew,wow..they left us for this.
"Normally a CHEP hater, but...",This is actually some weird and wonderful fun I wouldn’t normally associate with 7-11. 
No Redemption,"It’s the same as the Amaysim ad from 72 and Sunny, substituting cool and retro in lieu of having a creative idea.

You own this,Surprised they listed a full set of credits. Unfortunately for the creatives they’ll always be associated with this piece of…work.
RC,"Simple, fun and clever twist on a promo. Like."
@RC,Please explain how this is a clever twist on a promo? It comes in pretty straight and dry right at the end.
@Hard time for musicians,You say that as if Client Liason were ever meant to be taken as a serious band who just happened to have a lot of good mates at Triple J.
Data says no,CHEPs got their work cut out to redeem themselves after this.
Cringeeee,"Thanks CHEP, as soon as I hear that 80’s synth pop I forget what a shit year 2020 has been, what with all its death and despair.  Also can you tell me where this groovy festival is at? Looks pretty kickin’!"
Eww,"This is embarrassing for everybody involved.
Client Liaison did some memorable work a few years ago with their videos for Off White Limousine and Foreign Affair.
This is tacky and cheap. Terrible VFX. Non-existent direction.
And what’s going on with the make-up? They look ill.
Client Liaison are a novelty well past their expiry date."
Traffic,Probably should have put the creative people on the brief.
Oh dear,This is the same idea as Myer… what a difference crafting and execution makes.
