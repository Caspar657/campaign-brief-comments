Js,Good god that was long and boring,Reply
Impressed,"A very good brand spot for DJ’s and a nice change from the usual stuff we get fed at this time of year from the big retailers. This is some smart creative stewardship from Matty and Dave, they’re finishing on a high.",Reply
Santa,Very Nice.,Reply
Em,"Nice one, well done TBWA.",Reply
john lewis,imitation and flattery and stuff…,Reply
John Lewis,"Its nicely shot and will no doubt do well but I think fundamentally they missed a trick. There strategy and line isn’t tight enough as it is not intrinsically linked to David Jones.
Where John Lewis gets it right, is down the the fact that the line always comes back to how John Lewis is the shop for christmas; For those who care about showing they care, For gifts you can’t wait to give, Give a little more love this christmas, Give someone a christmas they’ll never forget, If you know the person, you’ll find the present, and Whoever you’re looking for this Christmas.
They all reinforce John Lewis is the perfect place to find the right present where as Things we do for love is so much weaker.
If you’re going to take influence from other great ads at least make them better.
But that said a nice ad so hats of to them.",Reply
Unhappy Xmas,This is how not to do it. It’s overlong and frankly boring. They give it away far too early and then you just waiting for it all to end.They should have a look at the brilliant John Lewis work again to see how it should be done.,Reply
I don't know if this is Dave and Matty,"From what I heard it was other people in the agency.
Nice spot though, just a little too long.",Reply
Night Owl,"Really tiresome, overly sentimental and most of all BORING! The Richard Clayderman impersonation on piano is tired and adds more syrup to the sugar bowl.",Reply
The Cynic,"I certainly wouldn’t be releasing the music. Why have two fails in one piece of work.
The whole thing just lacks emotion.",Reply
John Lewis,John Lewis John Lewis John Lewis,Reply
ian,"that’s why juan mata is not in the man utd team,he’s making commercials for david jones.",Reply
so-so,"1] the idea is good.
2] the director has done well and shot some great footage.
3] it needs to be re-cut [cut 30 secs out at least]
4] the soundtrack needs re-mixing – more optimism/joy is needed
5] do the above and it could go from ‘so-so’ to ‘fantastic’.",Reply
For all the Christmas haters.,"What’s easier than attacking a creative idea/ad???
… comparing all emotive Christmas spots to John Lewis ads.
This is a lovely, Aussie, Christmassy idea which has been well executed.",Reply
Generic shlock,"I think we are all fairly sold on the idea of Christmas. Nostalgia, yep – like that too.
The bigger challenge is why should I drop my dough on pressies at DJs.
Joh Lewis, you are right.",Reply
Old school,I thought emotional ads were supposed to be emotional. Just saying.,Reply
Nice one,It brought tears to my eyes. Well done.,Reply
Santa's underpants,Love!!!,Reply
Phil,Brought tears to my eyes too but not in a good way.,Reply
wear out factor,"didn’t mind it, but I wouldn’t watch it again if it came on, nothing to make me want to do that.",Reply
elf,"If this was under my Xmas tree, i’d be very disappointed…..it’s dull and laboured.",Reply
Sweet,"I really liked it. Except for the last part when the kid looks like he got up on Christmas morning at 10am. I’m calling BS on that.
Otherwise lovely.",Reply
NOEL,"So SO horribly mawkish.
Thank Christ Christmas only comes once a year.",Reply
only in advertising land!,Where else does the youngest member of the family get up the latest…what kind of insight is that?,Reply
Yes and no.,"Hats off for getting a spot past David Jones that doesn’t have David Jones bags / products in every scene. Almost.
But no respect for blatantly ripping off John Lewis with an ‘Australian’ angle. The spot’s nice but the idea’s been done and will be judged accordingly.
And it really does lack emotion. That’s something you can’t manufacture.",Reply
Criminal,Putting a chimney on Harry Seidler’s modernist masterpiece – now that’s just criminal.,Reply
Your mother,"Laboured, dull and full of cliches. An over sentimental track doesn’t make up for the lack of emotion in the execution. No reality, no connection, no cut through. Totally forgettable.",Reply
