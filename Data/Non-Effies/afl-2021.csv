"Done before, but better",These famous coaches speeches were so much better the first time the AFL used them for a finals campaign. Back in the George Patts days- when AFL ads made you feel something. 
"@Done before, but better","Um, did you mean to link to an ad done by Patts?
You’ve linked to the reference material for this latest ad.
I’m confused. Maybe you are too?"
Awful,"No other way of describing this, hopefully one of the codes in Australia will stand up and not make the same ad over and over again.."
Down before.,"Yes. These original interviews where they remembered their famous speeches were filmed for and used in rhe AFL’s 2008 finals campaign. They are recycling them again- but this time without the simple conviction of seeing the coaches, and without the brave heart soundtrack. Basically without the good stuff. While we are going through rhe back catalog- AFL’s best one here."
The Fans Like it,"A nice ad without the Bullshit,  Agencies work of late is dialing up the cringe and wank factor x 1000 .. "
Trolls,"So So tired of reading whoever you are bagging your colleagues when no-one goes into this Business trying to make a crap Ad!
We all know the end result is subject to a 100o factors and most of them out of your control."
