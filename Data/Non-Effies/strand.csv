CD,"Really nice shoot.
Not what you’d expect from a shopping centre… better photos than the stuff being done for Myer and DJs at the moment."
on,shame they went for the old anorexic look. Who wants to look like a lollipop?
history,"who wants to look like a lollipop?
throughout history, the most desirable body shapes have always been those that are most commonly sported by the privileged.
When poor people were emaciated and super skinny due to poor/insufficient diet, plump body shapes and curves were what people desired.
Now that poor people are obese due to poor diet, people want to look the opposite of that.
It’s just the way things are.
But don’t worry. When global warming causes a worldwide famine, plump chicks will be all the rage again."
ST,Really beautiful work.
PB,"I agree with CD, the shots are much better than the latest Myer and DJs campaigns. Beautifully photographed and love how they background compliments. Love it!
Actually I’ve just looked at The Strand and James’ stuff online and the do some pretty amazing stuff. Nice work guys."
