hmm,"Seriously, get out of your own arses. What’s the actual idea?
A case study about a room with some computers in it ?? What next, a case study about  a server room? An edit suite?"
Welcome to the 21st century,"Hey there hmm,
News flash for you, advertising isn’t just about broadcasting on traditional media anymore. Brands want to engage their customers and have a conversation with them. A bit like this blog we’re on! Go home and sit by the fire and listen to your radio Grandad."
21st century con,"Whilst you would reach around 4m people with a single TV commercial tonight. With twitter and Facebook, significantly fewer, around 600k, can be ‘uniquely engaged’ .
Brilliant. Media genius. I cannot wait for the case study on this."
Old Ad Guy,Welcome to the 21st century – Is that you Aden?
hmm,"@welcome to the 21st century
so you basically created a call centre, but on twitter. Well done.
I’ll go back to my fire now, don my slippers, and see if I can’t admire a couple of actual ideas."
A social disease,Sadly even the grandad taunts from the social wankers don’t make sense… Go like yourself… Most overhyped phenomenon in the history of advertising.
Dumb and dumber,Shit I may just watch the game… Good luck for those engaging with the community and all that bollocks
Nuddy Ruddy,Did you guys hire the streaker?
Actual Idea,"Here is an idea for you hmm.
Let’s interrupt people with 30 seconds of moving pictures and audio."
Karl,"To 21st Century Con – The article says that a single facebook post reached 600,000 unique people.  Just one post.  On one platform.  For free.  I’d guess the cost of your 30 sec ad just got trumped by a free tool that reaches many many millions over and over again.  While you guys are in front of the fire coming up with ideas, feel free to fall in."
Actual Idea,"Watch out all you old folk looks like this social disease is contagious

Aden,"@ Old Ad Guy… Ha. Nope not me, but I just read and did laugh a little!"
Young Ad Guy,These comments did not age well… Every company and government in the world has one of these rooms now. Lol ad agencies are old.
