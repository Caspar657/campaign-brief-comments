Hello,Nice to see the old faster than a speeding bullet idea again.
Old Broken Record Guy,"Think i saw this in an AWARD School student’s “first idea” scamps in 1988.
Hope they follow it up with the “like sh@t off a shovel” idea too."
pseudonym,"Even if it’s been used a trillion times over, I would rather see this idea again and again over some of the non-sensical hype reel odd just for being odd drab that seems to be a plaguing the Australian Ad industry at the moment."
Rich,It isn’t?
Under 40 said,What’s Print??
John,They fired a blank here…an idea as old as a Colt 45.
@under 40,"It would also work as a banner ad, don’t worry – it could get that 0.001% click through rate.
Or perhaps, if you were over 40, you’d realise that grown ups who might buy this car probably read things called magazines and newspapers, which they get delivered to their offices.
The bigger question is, what fucking creative director would let this idea out the door. Regardless of it being old it’s a lie, it’s not as fast as a bullet.
fucking hell. Useless."
Quick Draw McGraw,"“OK boy, now you park your little car way down yonder and when I count three, you start drivin toward me. Then, when I’m good and ready, I’ll unload Ol’ faithful here and we’ll see who’s really quick and who’s really dead.”"
Another Art Director,"Looks sweet, good one guys. Wish I was making work, looks fun."
vince the cleaner,Good to see the senior creatives at Whybin working hard.
over 40,"Dear under 40
at least you’re honest, in that you weren’t taught the craft of advertising fully, or properly. How’s that studio treatin’ ya?"
ann ominous,"wow, kids! harsh. angry. even a little bitter, perhaps?"
Damn...,"…I thought it was kind of nice for a minute, given I can’t even remember the last time a half decent print ad for a car brand was done out of this country.
Thanks Hello, Old Broken Record Guy, pseudonym, Rich, Under 40, John and @under 40 for teaching me otherwise. Looking forward to seeing your ground breaking automotive advertising featured here in the future. X"
Donkey Kong Jr.,I dunno. It’s simple and clean. I don’t mind it  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Ye Olde School,"Amongst the idle dross I find a print advertisement of yore, simple, to the point, but ’tis a-feared it be complete and utter bollocks.
Speed to yonder point be the least of the carriage’s skills.
But the others be difficult to communicate. So the scribe and pinter take the route of ease.
As mine brethren under 40 so eloquently sayeth, Fuck Off.  Try harder.
And what’s more, bullets be the colour of lead, and quite lacking in shine.
Print may not be dead, but ads like this kick it while it’s moaning upon the ground."
zero truth,if there was an ounce of truth to it it would be good. but its not. and its old. and a desert reflection? why not just throw a lens flare in there too just for good measure.
John,"@Damn……You don’t mind that it’s unoriginal then? This idea has been done by numerous car advertisers before, many times. When it does the rounds of the award shows, judges who are there because of their integrity and craft, won’t give a second look."
This guy,Whoever took that photo must have lightning reflexes.
Old Broken Record Guy,"For those who don’t get it, the point here is that the idea is a well worn cliche.
Regardless of how “nice” this execution might be, it has been done to death.
And generally the tradition of great creative people in most eras is to forge new territory, do stuff we haven’t seen before (which also applies to other creative pursuits, music, art etc).
So it doesn’t mean it isn’t a nice idea, and it doesn’t mean it might not be well received by its audience. But it is just a very familiar, well worn idea, which makes it very hard to applaud its “creativity”.
If you are happy to just repackage what has gone before and expect praise go right ahead. Those who think that probably got a ribbon for participation at school and thought they achieved something.
Mind you it might be worth doing a bit of advertising history research in those oh so old analogue book things called award annuals.
I think I know the reason we haven’t really seen any sort of new popular music form created in the last 15 years. Not pushing for it."
Rich,"@Damn…stop getting personal you infant (yes I know that I did there).
This is a blog for advertising and my issue is that this ad for a car is incorrect. The car is not as quick as the image suggests. So it’s wrong or a lie. I don’t give a fuck what it looks like but I beleive ads should be about a truth. And this ad does not ring tue to me."
@ @under 40,"Or it could be a website, an app or whatever else isn’t printed. Stop playing the banner ad card, it’s getting a little old. Just accept print is taking a back seat in the digital age.
And over 40 year olds buy GT-Rs? Mid-life crisis maybe?"
Old Broken Record Guy,"Can we just get our heads around the fact that the medium is irrelevant, regardless of digital or print or whatever “modern” approach, the idea is a relic of the past.
Separate idea from medium, because only in very rare (and usually fleetingly limited) cases is the medium the idea."
hot tub time machine,Let’s brainstorm like it was 1978!
@rich,"Sure, cos Red Bull really does give you wings and the burgers are actually better at Hungry Jacks.
Pffff,"
SHOOT IT DOWN.,"Has been done many times before with different executions…..you can look ’em up in AWARD annuals and D&AD and the Idaho Golden Carrot Awards.
To the Digital Creatives that mock print advertising, a word of advice.
You create an idea with words and pictures working in harmony.
I don’t see a lot of that in digital, if any, it’s a worry our creatives are not that creative and mainly Tech Heads assuming a creative position.
Australia’s creative has been heading south for many years as the youngsters coming through have not been trained in the , dare I say it…. the traditional way.
Wise up Australian Creatives. Go back and study the annuals and see what has been done before by the Traditionalists. Don’t repackage, don’t steal. Think different.
Stop trying to masquerade as creative when you really are a Tech Head.
Leave it to Creative people, you do your Tech job and change your job description on your business card next Monday morning, first thing.
Good Luck!"
Old CD Guy,"Girls! Stop squabbling about whether it’s original or not, or whether it’s a naive AWARD School standard ad or whether the bullet should be shiny or not or whether digital is better or worse than conventional print.
My two cents worth is this; it’s just a wrong strategy for 2015.
Speed is soooo last century. We’re living in the era of speed cameras. You just can’t enjoy a fast car any more. And anyway, everybody knows a GT-R is a ridiculously fast car. Planner: Find something surprising to say about it. I
don’t say any of these things because I’m a speed wowser or out of a sense of socially responsibility. I used to drive a Ferrari."
crikey,"not a new or original comparison to make for a car, but i for one, don’t mind the execution and craft.
however, what concerns me are the comments saying the car is not as fast as a bullet, and that’s why the ad is bad, blah blah blah.
i assume those comments are from suits, because taking something so literally like that is usually up their alley.
here’s the thing – exaggeration is a simple way to communicate something’s USP.
Is a Volkswagen polo so tough that it actually protects people from gunfire?
Of course not. It’s just a fun exaggeration of the USP."
Lemon,"@ shoot it down, I think you’ll find it’s not just digital creatives criticising the ad."
Steve McQueen,"How do we know that the car isn’t just traveling at around say 50-60km/h and that the bullet is simply overtaking the car? And are they trying to kill a vampire with that silver bullet or does the gun owner simply have OCD and likes to polish his bullets until he can see his reflection in them before firing them alongside a passing car.
Am I reading too much into this?"
Tip toes,"@ zero truth. haha! very true. This ad is what seems like a huge list of many scamps drawn. Although it may have worked very nice on paper, it falls somewhat flat in execution. The standard should have started very high to be then exceeded, but in all honesty, if this is what a senior team is executing, it is very worrying for tbwa i have to say."
