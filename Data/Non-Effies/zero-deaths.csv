Old CD Guy,"Love the strategy of introducing family/loved-ones as priority in your thinking about worthwhile lives in relation to road safety. But I found the clumsy, cloying sentimentality a turn-off. But then, I am a heartless bastard who loathes ordinary people, especially fat ones."
Zzzzzzzzzzz,"I just don’t like the trend of ads trying to act like activations chopped into 30 sec ads.
Clem’s tend to do this a lot, to make their ads look ‘modern’."
Doubting Tom,"Totally unrehearsed? Gee, lucky they just happened to have 70 people ready to go!"
DC,Brilliant. Nailed it
zzz,yawn

And now as a TV spot in 2015."
Hmmmm...,"This idea did not come from Clemenger. They’ve executed something that was given to them by TAC. And not that well, If I may say."
Snap!,"Okay so from the US to TAC and then re-hashed and spat out with complete inauthenticity here by the agency who either couldn’t be fucked coming up with something original, or just took orders from the client.
Whichever way it was, you can have no respect for it or anyone involved.
What are creative departments paid for? Coming up with ideas? Or stealing them and then misrepresenting their origin? How about all the people who worked on it, thinking they were doing something that wasn’t ripped off? Do people think that if they stole if off Youtube someone isn’t going to track that shit down in about five minutes flat these days?
Hang your heads."
What?!,"Snap, maybe the Transport Accident Commission was more bothered about saving lives than comments on an advertising blog?!"
Really,The framing of the sound boom in the beginning really captures the authenticity… Lame.
D#,"it’s beautifully dramatic and heart felt… but should’t advertising aim to change behaviour?
Having accidents is bad…. ok i think we all know that. Yes lower the road toll. Sure that’s good too. OK lower it to zero neatly reframes the problem….. but where’s the solution?
What is this trying to make people do? Have fewer accidents? How?"
vince the cleaner,"I’m with doubting tom on this one. Unscripted my arse.
Yawn"
Joe,Unscripted or not…. Such a great idea. Well done Glue.
