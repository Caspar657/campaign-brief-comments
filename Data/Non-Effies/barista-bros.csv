Hope the coffee is more authentic than their commercials.,Seen better done by kids on i phones and after so many great “adventure ads” that have gone before doesnt get much more laboured than this
International Roast,"Overcooked, leaves a very bitter taste in the mouth. Dream brief left wanting…."
Is there no end...,to the utter shit that comes out of that place? Me thinks not.
crapola,"wow…talk about lacking authenticity..this is one of those stinkers that client will look back in 2 months when they see the ROI and go , that was a massively wasted op."
Coffee,"Most coffee farmers in third worlds don’t even drink coffee and find it strange that’s what the beans are used for. They do it for the money, not the love of coffee."
More Ogilvy drip filtered dross,They went all the way to South America and came back with these Brand Power ads? No wonder the creatives and production house aren’t named… I’d be embarrassed too. The concept and totally unconvincing executions were clearly “approved by those who know nothing”. Needs a double shot – to the head.
first thought,…
Borderline,What’s with the racial stereotyping?
Ogilvy,"Lost it a long time ago and are probably too far gone to make a comeback.
Big name agency making mediocre stuff for clients who don’t seem to know any better.
Client & agency equally at fault.."
Bad,Just bad.
Nathan,Powdered milk kills it for me.
Poor Taste,So Luiz lost his thumb in the coffee making process?!  Talk about selling a product that promotes cheap labour!
Ricardo,"I am from South America and find it very annoying and even racist!
First, the person they interviewd is from Argentina (I can tell by the accent), a country that does not produce coffee At all! They depicts a “south american” ‘ -it doesnt matter the country because it seems like it is all the same- in a very ravist and stereotypical way.
I find it annoying and offensive."
Luke,"Came here to say just what Poor Taste said.
I read that poster this way…
“Luiz would’ve given it two thumbs up, but we have terrible OH&S compliance, so he only has one. LOL”
Thanks, but I’ll stick to ethical sources."
Yuck,It taste like Sunshine powdered milk with a low quality coffee powder thrown in
katee,Making a joke about an old guy missing a thumb? Seems a bit sick.
Sara,"I actually find it tasty, a lot like toffee in my opinion. I understand the racial anger about this and I of course agree, stereotyping is plain wrong. But the creators of the coffee must of worked hard. So in my opinion, delish "
Gimme some,"Can’t get enough of it and they have no stock left.
A company that size can run out of stock well onya coke "
Jared Lawler,Should watch “a film about coffee” recently released it follows the process of producing coffee. the sad FACT is that most farmers have never ever tasted their own coffee! There is a great scene of all the farmers tasting the coffee for the very first time…
Jeff,To much sugar and does not taste at all like coffee thums down
Cassie,Absolutely delicious! So different to other iced coffees in stores!
José,"That is ironic. This advertising was created in Uruguay or Argentina (by the accent) but none of those countries produce coffee. They should have gone to Colombia or Perú, which are located on the other side of the continent."
