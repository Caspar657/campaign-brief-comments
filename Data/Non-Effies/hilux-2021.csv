Lost teddy bear,Such a clear gulf in creativity between the Auckland and Sydney offices.
Cherbro,That’s the stuff. Was listening to the B-side podcast and they were talking about where all the strong simple ads had gone. Maybe NZ stole them all. Awesome work S&S.
C-Diddy,Bugger!
Maur,"Best Toyota ad I’ve seen since Country Border Security.
S&S Sydney, lift your game."
Brian,Don’t Melbourne do the Aussie Toyota work?
Style,It’s an ad only New Zealand could make. The subtlety alone on the ute shots would never get client sign off here. “What do you mean we spend 80% of the ad on closeups of drivers faces and a not seeing the ute in action? And a women driver!” Nice work S&S AKL
@Muar,That Kluger ad was good. Could have been Melbourne.
Finally,"Some actually funny dialogue.
NZ leaves Australia in the dust for comedy ads.
A lot to learn from this."
DC,This is so good.
Unbeleibowitz,Great stuff. Miss you Shatford.
DK,Great first project Steve. Lovely spot. The dialogue is like talking to you in parts.
@Style,"Agree. You can’t make this kind of ad in Australia, and it’s not for lack of trying."
Lost in translation,"It’s almost as though when the advertising text book was circulated to the antipodes, Australia mistook creativity to mean just clever tactics and didn’t pick up on the all important need for a creative idea first that holds everything together. "
“Pants...,…Are just long sleeved shorts”. This is the best ad I’ve seen come out of Australasia in years. Nice bloody work S&S.
lamington,"THIS IS SHIT! Also, Kiwi’s, laminations are ours!"
Genital-men,"Nice, nice, nice, nice, nice ad."
Sgt. Sardine,One of the best ads I’ve seen
Excellent,"Well done Shatford.
When will Aus remember how to be funny"
Stu A,Lovely spot
Bob,I’m loving the little odd-ball bits of dialogue that would never get through most clients and certainly research.
Jealous.,This is good. Really. good.
It’s embarrassing,NZ advertising puts Australia to shame.
Really?,"This idea is so average, but shot and directed well. "
Kiwi in Sydney,I wanna go home.
NZ vs Oz,As a kiwi who’s lived in Sydney for a while now this ad sums up the difference in humour between our two countries. 
Critic,"Surely ‘Sausage’ for that pot noodle is better. Better production values, better acting, better insight and starting with a better idea to begin with."
Menk Rutson,"Perfection. Simple, familiar occasion, creatively boosted with brilliant writing, excellent casting and all showcasing the depth in a product range."
Jack Sparrow,Congrats to all involved. Great idea. Flawless execution.
this is how its done.,congratulations all round
K/WK,"Brilliant. This one made me laugh. I can feel that historic Hilux/Hilux Surf look and feel come through from previous campaigns.. e.g. bugger. The dialogue wins it. I don’t think it’s entirely fair to compare the quality of creative between AU and NZ. Whilst we do share similarities, there are cultural differences in society, corporate, clients etc."
Matt Smith,Awesome work S&S NZ and brilliant direction and casting by Damian Shatford and Sweetshop!! It’s been a while since I’ve had the ‘wish I’d done that’ feeling. Probs cause I live and work in Sydney haha. Congrats all involved and thanks. Love an excellent TVC.
Nice,“Canyonero”
best thing in the covid era,same as above
Paul Maxwell,"Excellent work, though judging by the credits, it edited itself!"
PJP,"As an owner of a new 2021 Hilux Cruiser and previously a 2013 SR5 Hilux 4×4, I am truly impressed. The new Toyota Hilux ad is a true winner. Long live the Hilux."
