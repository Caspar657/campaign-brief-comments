"Please, make it go away quietly.","Pity the crowds didn’t drown out yet another over-written, inwardly reflecting, boring manifesto ad.
So boring. Where are the new ideas? The sport manifesto? Give the great game of AFL some credit.
And it looks like the animatic was dispatched. Its not even NRL standard, sorry."
Lion,Nice. Whoever got that performance out of Browny deserves most of the credit.
I get it...,Quite simply a little boring.
Jack Russell,"I liked Jonathon Brown’s supposed quote in the presser. “Resonated”…. please. Unless, of course, that’s Browny speak for what happens on an end of season jaunt. “Blacky got resonated…”"
Pen,Has an idea. Has craft. Has emotion. Done.
Don't go.,"This is a disgrace for the great game of afl. It is boring, uninspiring, and falls flat.  I’d go back to patts if this is what cummins are turning out.
Also, the overwhelming out take I get is “don’t go”.
I predict the worst finals crowds ever.
But cummins are on fire…"
buddy,so boring…..
Well done,So painful to watch.
Cheap and Nasty,The writing is incredibly corny. Also thought the teasers I saw during the week looked horrible.
Zzzzzzzzz,"Wow, that was a boring regurgitated shadow of a Nike Ad.
Served on a plate of tired stock images, familiar grades and cliched narration.
Lazy, stale work.
What happened to AFL, their ads used to be so good???"
Ed,"Wake me up when the finals are over!
If these ads are any indication, I’ll be watching from home with a few beers and the 89 Grand Final on tape.
Sorry, but that’s crap work guys. Doesn’t do anything for the sport."
Cut from the same cloth,"Basically the same ad as this effort by Cummins for the competitors sport.
http://www.melbournestorm.com.au/news/2014/03/06/storm_launches_2014_fan_up_campaign.html
Why would AFL want the same repetitive VO style ad, banging out an average end line for the duration of a one and a half minute ad??
It’s dull as dish water and it is super lazy."
ASS,Meh!
Fan,Love it. Fans drive AFL.
Old Hack,Exactly what I would have done back in the day.
Rooboy,Disappointing. Bring back Tim Rogers.
Disappointed,"Why would you change agencies to do rubbish like this??
Was hoping for so much better.
Disappointed"
Suicidal,"Oh Jesus how can you do something so ,so lame against this brief?
Did anyone care?"
Sealy,This has put me to sleep. What a shame.
Oh no,"I’ve been waiting to find out why the AFL were so keen to change agencies, and they bring me this. Seriously? Beyond disappointing and so cringe worthy… I couldn’t even make it to the end of the spot."
VFL Park,Said ECD Jim Ingram: “These are not meant to be ‘high gloss corporate style’ ads”
Ouch,Worst AFL ad ever.
Dear Jim Ingram,"Please go back to the high gloss corporate style you bagged in your blurb, these are total rubbish, look cheap, sound dull and fail to entertain."
Browny,"Fuck that was boring, boys. Just taking it one crap ad at a time.
Seems like 2 senior creatives and 3 CD’s need to lift their work rate."
Kyles,"Proof that repeated concussions give AFL players brain damage.
Why make Browny sound like a wanker?
Bloody hell the guy has won 3 premierships, a coleman medal, all-australians and has his face busted up countless times: let him be ‘raw and real’ instead of reading some crap ode to some horrible pictures.
Browny, you deserved better mate."
Agree with Rooboy,"I’m not a massive Patts fan, but their work on AFL shits all over this, sorry."
The kid,Cringe!! This is awful…. just awful….
This ad will go quietly into oblivion,"Wow sorry guys but yeah it’s boring. Doesn’t give you the crescendoing, pumped up, chest-about-to-burst feeling some of the older AFL work arouses. Which I reckon is kind of what you want for a finals ad. And it sort of looks and feels like an animatic… haha… not a fan."
Observer,"Lots of strange stuff going on in the advertising lately.
Clients moving for shit work. Creative agencies losing business and pitches to what ends up being very dull campaigns.
Sorry to join the conversation but this is pretty bit shit boring for an exciting game."
agency should go very quietly,nothing to make a noise about here and no credits for writer says a lot
Bitter,Geez Patts how about you enjoy yr weekend instead of wasting yr time posting a bunch of negative comments. Don’t be so bitter.
blues,"execution aside, a campaign led with “DON’T GO”… as it’s first line is a marketing debacle."
Hmmm,A lot of negative comments over the weekend?? I wonder who would be so motivated as to do this? Bitter much?
Stepped on a land mine,"When your campaign idea centers on the words DONT GO and QUIETLY you are in all sorts of trouble.
Bring back Tim ROgers ACDC and the ads that pumped the finals up and made me want to go!!"
To Bitter and Hmmm,"Do decent work then no one will be bitter.
This stuff is bad. Clems and Patts worst is still miles better than this. If you work at Cummins you surely can’t be proud of this."
motivated by recognising good advertising,Thats enough isn’t it ?
question,"If the work patts previously did was so great, why don’t they have the project?"
Adam Ferrier,"Guys can you please stop playing silly buggers.
I am sure many of these comments come from a disgruntled band of people from one company."
boo,i’m not in the advertising game anymore. i keep an eye on the circus from a distance. it’s not a great ad. but who cares. creativity can be used for better things than making an afl ad.
AFL,"It’s clearly the AFL here. Yes, it’s not good. But I put the minimal budget they spent on this and bet that it’s AFL’s doing."
Dear Adam,"It’s crap work, people have a right to comment on it.
Make bad work and people will let you know, make great work and they’ll lord you for it.
It’s not always nice, but it’s the truth."
Browny,"Maybe I commented over the weekend, because I got the regular email from CB on Saturday.
And I am not a disgruntled person from that one company either."
Bull,Even I don’t make shit like that.
Melbourne Creative,"This is what happens when cummins & partners go into pitches with one very important point of difference: price…
Hence the pitch wins. Hense the shit quality productions."
First to the carpark,"If this was a game I would have left early to beat the rush.
A very tough thing to watch.
And no, I’m not on any big-agency cheersquad – just someone who works at a small place who would have loved a crack at this."
d,"While yes, I think this ad has a sense of insincerity and fake, cliché crescendo, it’s probably getting more bagged than it should because Cummins hasn’t really put a foot wrong yet until now. The agency has set a high bar. Emperors Clothes syndrome. Take the negativity as a compliment to all the other great work you guys are doing. You guys will get your mojo back."
Who,I think the client art directed this. And co-wrote it. And liked it.
Yawn,A really nicely crafted ad with a bit of an idea. What we see versus what we hear doesn’t marry up at all. May as well be two separate ads.
Cummins or AJF?,"Honestly, exactly what I expected!"
frankfrancione1@gmail.com,"I love my football,But this as has upset me,Dont go quietly Make a noise Do something
should I envisage Scenes of England football Watching the game played behind a cyclone fence unable to enjoy the game because of people who are going to the game just to make a noise!Do something? are you trying to incite a riot ?

Hello AFL is anyone there on the ball,"
Jezza,If my team played like this in the finals they’d lose by a hundred points. And if they were an EPL team they’d be relegated.
Malcolm,Everybody does shit stuff sometimes. Shame the account had to move for it though.
Tom G,"Wow.. Unsurprisingly that really stinks and less surprisingly a cummins representative  posts that the overwhelmingly negative reception on this site has been posted by the previous incumbent agency. Maybe just maybe, it’s because the work is really SHIT"
Forciblyfreelance,"I’d just like to thank you CB for providing a forum for cowards like us to tell it like it is. When you don’t have to disclose your identity, you can really let fly like the big dicked champion you are, without the fallout or ridicule that might occur if you did. So here’s to us! Anonymous Ad legends! Let’s take em’ all down, one tough arsed comment at a time, from the safety of this toilet cubicle."
R,I liked it!
gezza,I watch lots of footy and had no idea what this campaign was about and where the ad has been aired? Had to look it up. And then I had to laugh as less than 40% of the crowd on Grand Final day will be club members. Want to make some noise? Seat club members together and let them actually attend rather than the bullshit corporates who couldn’t give a toss who wins as long as the food and wine is good in the box. Seriously is this campaign a sick joke?
