SUV it's not,,,"Stephen you might like to pick up on the BMW speak.
It’s an SAV – a sports activity vehicle.
SUV – ‘Utility’ – far too crass for the Munchkins."
yo see,,,"totally underwhelming.
these images could be taken on a long exposure with a handheld torch.
not exactly highlighting the power of the lights at all in this case
and shooting on film was the wrong choice."
Illuminating,,,"apart from being completely ripped off from the drone light photography, this is also really crap and boring for a car company. Clem’s truly slipping and you can understand why they lost T…."
"Creator, not a destroyer.",,,"It’s half decent. Like it. Nice to see a decent old print ad with an idea.
Better than a planners breakfast."
x,,,Nice work considering it’s for BMW. @photocopy Using a car to light a landscape is different enough for me.
Mercedes,,,This campaign will sell exactly….. zero cars. Well done on the launch of such an important vehicle for BMW. The dealers will need these lights to see as they close their dealerships for the final time.
Yeah nah,,,"I really really wanted to like this, I was excited when I saw it. But yeah nah, the photography falls short, I looked at the site and I still dont know what the car looks like and my $22,000 car lights up 12 trees just like this does. It feels like the “lets use the new X5 to create landscape artworks” sounded better than the actual outcome. Hate to say it but I think there was a massive missed opportunity here. Surely having two cars so one is in shot and one lit it would have created a better execution. It all kinda looks a bit cheap and low-fi. And like it was lit by a flashlight.
Damn it."
ad critic,,,When did Clems part ways with Merc?
