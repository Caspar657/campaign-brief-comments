Roger Rabbit,"I really respect Atomic 212 but this is truly pointless.
They’ve used a tool that’s free for anyone (keyword planner) that provides absolutely no real insight into the race.
Perhaps if they’d created their own algorithm or tracked social media mentions (e.g. the ‘Warmest 100’), or even live streamed a funny random prediction (e.g. Paul the Octopus) this press release would have been a bit more interesting."
