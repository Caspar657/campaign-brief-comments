I thought,"this was a new Belong ad when I first saw it. What’d they tell us in AWARD school – if two people have had the same idea, it’s not good?"
Nope,"Oh my god this is so disturbing and off-putting.
Why on earth ‘Australia Post’ have to advertise this time of the year is beyond me.
Gov’t money wasted and not right. Where’s Scomo when you need him."
Zac,Singing letterboxes. Giant yellow ball thing. BFCing fun. Is Australian advertising getting good again?
@Zac,"The giant yellow ball thing was funny and entertaining my friend.
Badly executed singing letterbox’s is on the nose."
Customer Experience,No amount of advertising can polish the colossal turd that is the Aus Post Customer Experience
Ffs,"First it was the flogged montage, now it’s the flogged inanimate objects singing. First Belong, then yellow tennis ball, now letter boxes. What’s next? An advertising creatives’ brain?"
Simple and fun.,Better than most of the Christmas ads I’ve seen so far.
Must be good,This made me smile. And my mail is two months late.

Decline,"The tide has turned, the monkeys now do the most boring work."

>:0,I remember when The Monkeys were good.
Better,"than previous Aus Post spots. This one has character, and humour, and insight. Lovely stuff."
Jim Henson,I like.
KGB,@ Nope – spot on. Demand already outstripping supply. What exactly is the commercial purpose of this work? 
nah,this ain’t good…
Why,"Govt money wasted on a product that does not need advertising.
To quote Geoff Toovey – we need an investigation!"
Come on,"Belong and Rollin are in another league.
They are both surprising,utterly charming and artfully created.
This work isn’t.
Pease stop comparing."
I bet 2 things,"1 – This is loved more than Belong and Rollin by real people in the world, not on this blog.
2 – That this will be noticed more."
Just so you know.,"My 68 year old mother -in -law is absolutely fascinated by Belong.She’s really charmed by it.
Asked if I’d done it and I almost lied."
Silence the Critics,"I don’t mind this ad, but it’s a familiar idea. We’ve seen inanimate objects singing many times before. ‘Belong’ being one of them. "
Santa Claus,"Out of all the “ad guy(zzzzz)” commenters that just posted here, have you seen the Xmas ads out right now? Even John Lewis.. They’re all uninspired rubbish (Coles, Big W, Target- The list goes on). At least this one is a fun and simple get. Did Belong just release a similar ad recently with a bunch of inanimate rocks singing that no-one understood and doesn’t make any sense and I still don’t know why they made it, and why the f*ck are the rocks singing, and what does that have to do with my internet….. Yeah, that similar ad does exist (unfortunately for Australia Post), but remember when Volcano starring Tommy Lee Jones came out in 1997 and the next month Dante’s Peak starring Pierce Brosnan came out, and they were both about Volcano’s erupting… Yeah, sometimes that stuff happens in life.. But you pick the better one, which in that case was clearly Dante’s Peak.. And in this case, is clearly Australia Post. So everyone… plz have a glass of coke, smile and STFU- None of you know what you’re talking about anyway you bunch of muppets…"
Scrooge,I preferred the Tommy Lee Jones movie. So you know nothing.
HUJO,Are Hugh Gurney and Joe Sibley the modern day MOJO? I feel a Russel Howcroft tribute documentary coming on.
"monkey sing, monkey do",how many of the monkey’s ideas are just “take a famous song and just use that instead of having an idea!” 
"Jeffrey, Jeffrey Bezos","Making inanimate objects sing isn’t original, and it wasn’t when some rocks did it last week. I’d suggest that Aussie Post is basically a business delivering packages bought online and this spot owes much more to Amazon than Lady Gaga’s rocks: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WoFd4bjrtbA"
SO BAD,"What is happening here and why?
Dogs breakfast"
"hey everyone, STFU","I really just came here for the comments. And WOW–you’re all jaded.
If this (pretty enjoyable) ad makes you unhappy, it’s time to quit the biz. You’ve all been leaving you’re negative comments (and making more average ads than this) for far too long."
Stop deep-diving,"Take it for what it is, where it lives and who will see it. It’s a nicely made ad with joy that takes the focus off the pressure AusPost is facing at the moment. Nice one to all involved – would be stoked to have this under my belt."
Former Aus Post creative,"Getting something decent up working on Australia Post is the creative equivalent of a defector escaping North Korea on foot with nothing but a stick-on moustache and novelty glasses. Everyone canning this has never worked on this client, I guarantee. High fives to the creatives behind it."
Gengis,"It’s great,  Fun, catchy tune and  a makes one smile ad.
What we need after what we all been going through."
