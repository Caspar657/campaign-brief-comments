This ad tastes crap.,Jimmy Brings makes an ad about shit tasting alcohol which leaves viewers with the thought that jimmy bring delivers gross alcohol. Corny.
Relevant,Jimmy stunts are spot on. Always seem to be relevant and slightly crazy… will never forget Toilet paper in 30mins. This is bloody funny too
Jim,You are quickly developing a reputation as the worst advertiser in marketing
Piss weak,Good thing I left this agency! Can’t believe these kinda works gets put out and PR’rd! 
Bundy already did it,They perfected the taste of 2020 in 1888.
No credits?,When is the retainer up?
Actually,"It’s a pretty good idea, just executed pretty badly. And then they exported the raw file."
